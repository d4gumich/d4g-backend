3898496,"The United States, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is providing $1 million in immediate humanitarian assistance to support the people affected by unprecedented flooding in Nigeria. The unusually heavy rainfall and resulting flooding has affected nearly 2.8 million people across the country. In addition, tens of thousands of homes have been damaged or completely destroyed, forcing the displacement of two million people. More than 600 people have died.  The floods have exacerbated an already critical humanitarian situation in Nigeria, where ongoing conflict, especially in the northern region, has already driven  millions of people from their homes. In the same region, more than four million people are projected to continue experiencing acute food insecurity amid the worsening global food crisis. To make matters worse, we are concerned that standing floodwaters could also increase the risk of cholera and other waterborne diseases in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states, where cholera outbreaks were declared in August and September and at least 7,750 cases were recorded. In 2022, 31 out of 35 states reported cholera cases.  Today's $1 million in new USAID support will allow local partners on the ground to provide emergency shelter repair kits and hygiene kits to promote safe and healthy practices amid the ongoing cholera outbreak, and multipurpose cash assistance for people impacted by the devastating floods.   As experts expect heavy rainfall to continue through November, USAID disaster experts will continue monitoring the situation in close coordination with humanitarian partners, the Government of Nigeria, and the U.S. Embassy in Abuja to assess needs and determine additional assistance needed.   The United States will continue standing with the people of Nigeria during this extremely difficult time and maintains a long history of providing humanitarian assistance across the country. In fiscal year 2022 alone, USAID provided more than $356 million in lifesaving, multi-sector assistance to people most affected by conflict and food insecurity.","['Epidemic', 'Flash Flood', 'Flood']","['Contributions', 'Health', 'Shelter and Non-Food Items', 'Water Sanitation Hygiene']","['Nigeria', 'United States of America']",News and Press Release
1251516,"Seventieth Session,   29th Meeting (AM)   GENERAL ASSEMBLY   MEETINGS COVERAGE    The Second Committee (Economic and Financial) met this morning to introduce 17 draft resolutions, including one on 'World Tsunami Day', which aimed to raise public awareness, promptly disseminate information through early warning systems and implement the concept of 'build back better'.  The representative of Japan introduced that draft resolution (document A/C.2/70/L.11), explaining that the choice of 5 November as the date for 'World Tsunami Day' was linked to several important lessons.  Among those, he noted that, on that day in 1854, a man in a village in Japan recognized the signs of an approaching tsunami after a large earthquake.  He saved the lives of his fellow villagers and they built back better than before.  Although tsunamis were a relatively rare phenomenon, they caused tremendous damage in terms of loss of human life and destruction of poverty.  Even individuals from countries which had never experienced tsunamis were not immune from the risk.  The representative of Chile said his country was affected by tsunamis and welcomed the resolution, which aimed to raise awareness and strengthen response mechanisms.  In order to forge resilient societies, it was important to include all sectors of societies in the build back better initiative.  The representative of Samoa introduced the draft resolution on 'International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development, 2017' (document A/C.2/70/L.5) under the agenda item on Sustainable Development, saying that, over the past several years, tourism had experienced significant growth.  That sector was responsible for 9 per cent of global gross domestic product (GDP), accounted for 30 per cent of the world's trade in services, created 277 million jobs and employed one out of every 11 people worldwide.  The important contribution of sustainable tourism to sustainable development was evident in the 2030 Agenda, she said.  The representative of South Africa, speaking on behalf of the 'Group of 77' developing countries and China, introduced a draft resolution on 'Combating sand and dust storms' (document A/C.2/70/L.22).  Noting that the Group was introducing the latter text for the first time to recognize the severe damages caused by such storms to the inhabitants of affected areas, especially in Africa and Asia, he said that cooperation at the regional and international levels would be vital for preventing and managing their adverse effects.  That was one of several texts he introduced on sustainable development, the most comprehensive item on the Committee's agenda.  Other texts included  'Oil slick on the Lebanese shores' (document A/C.2/70/L.14), 'Follow-up to and implementation of the SIDS [small island developing States] Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway and the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States' (A/C.2/70/L.17) and 'International Strategy for Disaster Reduction' (A/C.2/70/L.15).  Further texts under that agenda item concerned 'Protection of global climate for present and future generations of humankind' (document A/C.2/70/L.18) and 'United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development' (document A/C.2/70/L.20).  The delegate also introduced a draft resolution on 'Information and communications technologies for development' (document A/C.2/70/L.23) and two texts on macroeconomic policy questions, including 'Unilateral economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion against developing countries' (document A/C.2/70/L.2) and 'International financial system and development' (document A/C.2/70/L.7).  On the agenda item on globalization and interdependence, he introduced a text on 'Culture and sustainable development' (document A/C.2/70/L.6) and another on 'Follow-up to the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries' (document A/C.2/70/L.19), which pertained to the agenda item on groups of countries in special situations.  Several texts were introduced on the eradication of poverty, including 'Implementation of the Second United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (2008-2017)' (document A/C.2/70/L.9), 'Women in development' (document A/C.2/70/L.8) and 'Human resources development' (document A/C.2/70/L.16).  The final text introduced by the Group of 77 today was on 'Permanent sovereignty of the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and of the Arab population in the occupied Syrian Golan over their natural resources' (document A/C.2/70/L.21).",['Tsunami'],['Disaster Management'],['World'],News and Press Release

3899120,"**Children are the most impacted by the catastrophic floods that have prompted the suspension of essential services like education and healthcare throughout most of Bayelsa State.**  *Nchekwube Nwosu-Igbo, Communication Assistant, UNICEF Nigeria*  Sagbama, Bayelsa State— Devastating floods are wreaking havoc in several communities in Bayelsa State, Southern Nigeria, and women and children are most at risk as emergency response has been slow. The floods have caused severe destruction of homes, roads, schools, healthcare institutions, and other essential infrastructure, leading to a humanitarian disaster.  Germany Akpoebi, a 45-year-old father of four, and his family reside in Indiamazi, Mile 2, Sagbama LGA of Bayelsa State. Where he calls home has almost been run over by the devastating flood waters. Germany's case is not an isolated one. In fact, many residents in the area have completely deserted their homes because of the floods, and this has negatively impacted their sources of livelihood and education.  With several schools, businesses, and health centers shut down already, this year's flooding has been extremely devastating for Germany and his family. The flooding is attributed to several factors, including heavy rainfall and climate change. Man-made factors, like the lack of proper drainage, have contributed in no small way to making the floods more devastating. In addition to worrying about potential diseases brought on by the floods, Germany is also concerned about his children, who have temporarily stopped attending school. Currently, school students in Bayelsa state are on ""flooding break"". Earlier in the month, the Bayelsa State Government directed public primary, secondary and private schools in the state to suspend all academic activities till further notice.  Three of Germany's four children—11-year-old Peretimifa in JSS 2, 9-year-old Joy in Primary 4, and 5-year-old Samuel in Primary 1—are quite upset at the turn of events. Their education has been impacted by the floods, as they are currently at home because of the flooding. Speaking for himself and his younger siblings, Peretimifa revealed that they miss school, their teachers, and their friends.  Germany is also worried that some of his sources of livelihood, like the small fishpond he runs at the back of his house has been completely submerged by floodwaters, leading to the loss of fish and potential income. Germany, who expressed bitterness at the devastating effects of this flood on his family and community as a whole, revealed that he was completely taken by surprise at the turn of events because the area he resides in is considered high ground and the center of the community, and should normally have been less impacted. He expressed concern about what the flood had done to families living in low-lying areas.  Germany is making an appeal to the government to fix the man-made issues that might help mitigate the flooding in the areas. He disclosed that he is preparing to evacuate his family should the flooding increase and overrun their home.  UNICEF has supported the government response in three affected states ' Jigawa, Niger, and Kaduna, including through the provision of cash assistance, distribution of cholera kits, government-led mobile health teams, temporary learning centres, learning kits and cholera kits. With additional support, UNICEF can scale up its response in other states to provide lifesaving medical equipment and essential medicines, chlorination of water and sanitation supplies, as well as support the prevention of and response to sexual and gender-based violence.","['Epidemic', 'Flash Flood', 'Flood']","['Education', 'Health', 'Protection and Human Rights', 'Water Sanitation Hygiene']",['Nigeria'],News and Press Release

2746944,"**Highlights**  - During the first half of 2018, the humanitarian situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea remained critical. According to the inter-agency 2018 DPRK Needs and Priorities document, up to 10.3 million people (41 per cent of total population) continue to suffer from food insecurity and undernutrition, as well as a lack of access to basic services.  - In June 2018, UNICEF in collaboration with the Government launched the 2017 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) Report, which revealed disparities between provinces and urban and rural areas. For example, stunting in rural Ryanggang is at 32 per cent, 22 percentage points above Pyongyang at 10 per cent. In rural areas, only one household in three uses water piped directly into the dwelling as a main source of drinking water. Although MICS results showed high coverage of health services, access to quality services is still limited which is essential for improved health outcomes.  - As of 30 June 2018, UNICEF and partners have reached 162,210 children under 1 year with routine immunization, and 163,236 pregnant women with immunization services. In addition, 1.38 million people received essential medicines and 96,556 children with diarrhoea received oral rehydration salts.  - On nutrition, nationwide about 1.3 million (90 per cent) children aged 6-59 months were screened during child health days and where needed, referred to treatment for severe acute malnutrition (SAM), moderate acute malnutrition (MAM), and follow up. 10,800 under five children with SAM were treated through the inpatient and outpatient programmes. Nearly 1.35 million under five children received vitamin A supplementation, and 450,000 children under two received multiple micronutrient powder.  - Despite the generous contribution of a few donors, a US$ 14.2 million (86 per cent) funding gap remains, resulting in difficulties to provide life-saving services for children in DPRK.  **SITUATION IN NUMBERS**  **2,832,500**   \# of children in need of humanitarian assistance   (Based on 2018 DPRK Needs & Priorities, March 2018)   **10,300,000**   \# of people in need (2018 DPRK Needs & Priorities, March 2018)  **UNICEF Appeal 2018**   US$ 16.5 million  **Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs**  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) continues to be in the midst of a protracted humanitarian situation. An estimated 10.3 million people across DPRK continue to suffer from food insecurity and undernutrition, as well as a lack of access to basic services. Recurrent natural hazards particularly extended droughts punctuated by recurrent flooding created challenge to the considerable proportion of the population to enjoy their basic right in health and wellbeing particularly young children, pregnant and breastfeeding women and other vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities and those with non-communicable diseases. As a result, people have crucial and unmet food, nutrition, health, water, sanitation and hygiene needs.  The 2017 MICS Report launched in June 2018 revealed disparities between provinces and urban/rural areas. One out of five children under 5 are stunted and face an impaired physical and cognitive growth. Geographic disparities exist, with stunting in rural Ryanggang (32 per cent), i.e. 22 percentage points above Pyongyang (10 per cent). In rural areas, only one household in three uses water piped directly into the dwelling as a main source of drinking water. In urban areas 71 per cent of the population have access to safely managed drinking water compared to only 44 per cent in rural areas.   Although- MICS results showed high coverage of health services; access to quality basic services is still limited which is essential for improved health outcome for children and women.  The international community has outlined the 2018 Needs and Priorities, which functions as an interagency appeal of the Humanitarian Country Team (HCT)1, which strictly prioritizes around life-saving support to the most vulnerable and in need of humanitarian assistance. Humanitarian agencies continue to focus on delivering a full package of support to the targeted beneficiaries to ensure they receive an integrated multi-sectoral support. The plan requires US$111m to respond to the most urgent food, health, nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene needs of approximately 6 million people, including 1.7 million under-five children and 342,000 pregnant and breastfeeding women.  As a result, in 2018 UNICEF estimated the need to treat about 60,000 SAM and 120,000 MAM children and to reach an estimated 60,000 people with clean water countrywide. UNICEF also plans to provide traditional vaccines for 355,000 children under one year of age, and 362,000 pregnant women; whilst also supporting the provision of Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) for treatment of diarrhea, and essential medicines for the treatment of pneumonia and other childhood illnesses in 94 focus counties.",['Heat Wave'],"['Contributions', 'Coordination', 'Food and Nutrition', 'Health', 'Water Sanitation Hygiene']","[""Democratic People's Republic of Korea""]",Situation Report

2973113,"**By examining how people react during an emergency, disaster relief organizations can better respond.**  By Andrew Schroeder  Over the past year, the role of social media in society has appeared to shift. Until recently, the predominant view was quite positive about increasing connections and access to information. Lately the tone has turned far more negative, focusing on the consequences, unanticipated or not, of widespread social monitoring.  Like many individuals and institutions, humanitarian organizations are also contending with these at-times-bewildering shifts in perception, policy and technology.  Rather than simply celebrating social media uncritically or disengaging from it given certain dystopian fears, it may be possible to find a more productive engagement with social media as a force for good. Humanitarian organizations can use these services in striking new ways, by focusing on what can be learned from the data being produced at greater-than-ever scale and speed.  Direct Relief, for instance, not only delivers messages through its social channels; it also derives insight from social media data sources to inform its understanding and advance its core mission of strengthening the health and well-being of people in situations of crisis and poverty. By drawing analytically upon these novel sources of data for good, Direct Relief and others have begun to see the outlines of an alternate future for how social media ' treated ethically and responsibly ' may play a more realistic and hopeful role in humanitarian operations.  **THE BEST (AND WORST) OF TIMES FOR SOCIAL MEDIA**  To see what's possible in the future, it's useful to understand more about the recent past.  Social media has existed for about 15 years. For most of that time, the platforms which marked its rise, including Facebook, Twitter and similar services, emphasized scaling personal communications and expanding new forms of marketing. The business model popularized by Google, and then later by Facebook, of monetizing user data to create targeted advertising, has been ascendant within and beyond the technology sector for the better part of two decades. Harvard professor emeritus Shoshana Zuboff goes so far as to describe it in her book, 'The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,' as an emergent economic system where profitability has been re-founded upon pervasive, commercially-focused monitoring by networks of apps, databases and mobile devices.  During the first decade of social media's rise, the creation of these new forms of digital interaction and commerce were viewed with near-utopian reverence. That sentiment shifted dramatically in recent years. Election hacking and Black Mirror-style social rating systems, among other things, have taken some of the proverbial bloom off the social media rose.  One of the key answers to this best-of-times/worst-of-times dilemma for social media in the humanitarian space has been for companies to create 'data for good' programs. Rather than just using the tools on their own, 'data for good' programs promote structured access by analysts to the core data resources. Through data sharing and protection agreements, companies with valuable private data can enable its use at enormous scale and frequency to conduct analysis and guide programs for the public benefit.  Direct Relief now engages in several corporate 'data for good' efforts, from social media to location intelligence to news publication and healthcare. These different services, on their own and in combination, are opening new possibilities for answering timeless questions about people and communities in crisis, their needs, and changes over time, especially during emergencies.  **THE THOMAS FIRE & FACEBOOK DISASTER MAPS**  Direct Relief's first experience with social media data for humanitarian use was a trial by fire.  In December 2017, the hills above Santa Barbara, where Direct Relief is headquartered, were an inferno. The Thomas Fire, at that time the largest in California's history, tore through neighboring Ventura County and carved its way north at an astounding rate. The air, right down to the shores of the Pacific Ocean, was a choking cloud of smoke, filled with particulate pollution. Direct Relief responds to many such wildfire events each year, but this one was different because of the scale, and its proximity to its headquarters.  In collaboration with the Santa Barbara and Ventura County Public Health Departments, Direct Relief staff fanned out to distribute thousands of N-95 masks for protection from the smoke.  Where should these masks be distributed for maximum effect? The fire was dynamic, changing literally with the winds. How could staff know where people would be at different times, and how many masks they might need?  A few weeks earlier,   hosted a webinar for a new product from Facebook's Data for Good team called 'Disaster Maps.' Facebook's user base is massive and spread out in dense patterns over virtually the entire planet. If people opt into a setting called location history on their mobile phones, Facebook is able to anonymize and aggregate this data at a neighborhood level and determine how, when and where populations move. Using these aggregated insights, Facebook can create maps of astonishing clarity about the dynamics of entire populations, in real time.  Facebook Disaster Maps are comprised of aggregated user locations within grid squares that are 600 meters on a side and are updated daily. The implications of these data for humanitarian aid are profound.  With access to such maps, which Facebook provides for free to organizations like Direct Relief that sign data-sharing agreements, questions about where and when to maximize things like N-95 mask distribution could start to be answered in new ways. Evacuation patterns could be analyzed to understand the degree to which people were evacuating their neighborhoods or staying behind. The ebb and flow of population density around planned distribution sites or health centers could be tracked throughout the day. The smoke plume pouring off the hills could be overlaid on that movement pattern to determine how many people were in areas of heightened respiratory risk.  Before too long, Direct Relief was making maps routinely from the Facebook data. Daily briefings filled with news of populations in motion. Connections emerged between these mobile clusters of people and information about pre-existing social vulnerabilities, which led to more detailed assessments of areas in need. The town of Montecito was hit in January 2018 with deadly mudslides. Within hours, Facebook disaster maps revealed the residents' movements, or lack thereof, in the affected area. Questions could be posed empirically of how those numbers lined up with official evacuation zones.  **SOCIAL MEDIA AS AN OPERATIONAL HUMANITARIAN PLATFORM**  When the emergencies of late 2017 and early 2018 finally subsided, a threshold had been crossed. Instead of making do with hypothetical assumptions about how people should behave during emergencies, humanitarian agencies like Direct Relief could base their actions on how people actually behave.  With each passing event, more can be learned about how to respond effectively and anticipate the needs of people in crisis, but it's not enough for it to reside at the 30,000-foot analyst view. For data like Disaster Maps to be truly impactful, it must get to the operational levels of humanitarian response. For Direct Relief, that means figuring out new ways to get data, and, more importantly, interpretations of that data, into the hands of people best placed to use it. By April and May 2018, workshops had been hosted with non-profit primary health centers in Texas to help them prepare for the upcoming hurricane season. The workshops demonstrated how Facebook Disaster Maps might have helped during Hurricane Harvey, had the tool been available at the time.  Simple insights from social media data could be revelatory in the right context. During Hurricane Harvey, the outlying areas of Houston saw elevated population levels for days. In contrast to news about overcrowded shelters downtown, the health centers in retrospect saw their broader lived realities reflected in the Facebook data. Resources were often needed most in the suburban and exurban zones, far from the city center. The same pattern played out later in the year with Hurricane Florence in the Carolinas and Hurricane Michael in Florida, where enormous pockets of need aligned with areas of high social vulnerability, in outlying areas, and away from the urban cores.  Part of the operational dimension of social media for humanitarian aid lies in linking new analytical capacities with the coordination capacity of the more familiar elements of the platforms. In the case of Facebook, Direct Relief piloted the use of groups to encourage coordination among health centers as well as a venue for distributing Disaster Maps. Through Facebook Groups, positive feedback loops emerged, helping guide analytical insights to those on the front lines of crisis while learning from them about the ground-level realities of events and the impacts of their actions.  Facebook Community Help, a service of Facebook Crisis Response that allows individuals to post their needs during an emergency and others to post their ability to meet those needs, also points the way towards a new humanitarian future where the services we're using to communicate resemble price signaling marketplaces. The demand for and supply of assistance can become increasingly precise and knowable even under the most chaotic conditions. Direct Relief secured the ability of primary health centers to post information into Community Help as institutions rather than individuals, which means that in upcoming emergencies real-time maps of need, supply, and response activity might be feasible.  **LEARNING FROM FACEBOOK DATA FOR GOOD**  Privacy concerns for all these new developments need to be kept front and center, given the recent cascade of revelations around privacy failures. How do humanitarian actors use granular information about populations in crises without jeopardizing them even more through the release of information which might be used to target or take advantage of them? Here too, the Data for Good team at Facebook arguably marks out a kind of best practice in the field. In order to access Disaster Maps or the underlying datasets of Community Help, Direct Relief agrees to stringent data protection protocols. Strong limits are placed on access, even blocking the use of APIs, to prevent unplanned or unwanted release of information. Companies that deal in private data could take more than one lesson in proper information management from the standards and trade-offs governing Facebook Data for Good.  Towards the end of 2018, after engaging with Facebook Data for Good for the better part of the year, Direct Relief began seeing an uptick in conversations with businesses about how their core datasets could likewise become useful during humanitarian response. Financial services, location intelligence, news media, healthcare and many other sectors began posing interesting questions about the terms, conditions and use cases that might transform their data assets into social goods for communities experiencing disasters.  Each company requires an answer that's distinctive to their corporate culture and the content of their data. Taken together though, these private datasets, which track money, health and the whereabouts of large-scale populations on a near-constant basis, and which in many ways now hold the highest value for humanitarian response, may find their way into a new common operational picture, at once public and private. When and if they do, humanitarian actors need to make sure that picture is governed by reasonable standards of privacy and effective information management, of the sort marked out in part by the Facebook Data for Good team.  To the surprise of the world, which at the close of 2018 seemed practically consumed by newfound fears of social media, and a repudiation of the earlier utopian impulses, perhaps the true legacy of Facebook's Data for Good initiative might be to illuminate a third path. It's possible that with the right guidance, ethics and emphasis on localized results, efforts like Disaster Maps will form a bridge between the private data which increasingly governs public life and the social good, which can be engaged through careful collaborative action.  Future social media users may be so fortunate one day to re-think these tools in their entirety from such a hopeful point of view.","['Tropical Cyclone', 'Wild Fire']",['Coordination'],"['United States of America', 'World']",News and Press Release
3744165,"Prepositioning relief supplies, increasing health system resilience and using data to inform action  **By Paul M. Sherer**  With the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season officially starting on June 1, Direct Relief is staging caches of emergency medical supplies along the U.S. Gulf and Atlantic Coasts and throughout the Caribbean and Central America.  The humanitarian effort comes as global temperatures keep rising and the frequency and intensity of hurricanes and other disasters increase. The 2020 hurricane season was the most active on record, producing 30 named storms, 14 of them hurricanes. Two were Category 4 storms, Eta and Iota, that crashed into Nicaragua two weeks apart, causing catastrophic damage and triggering a massive wave of displacement.  Direct Relief's prepositioned modules contain the medical items most needed in the wake of a disaster, including trauma supplies, antibiotics, and medications for diabetes, hypertension and other chronic conditions. The supplies are made available through local health organizations serving communities most vulnerable to natural disasters. The modules vary in size from 112 pounds for individual clinics to larger 1,680-pound modules for international destinations.  Direct Relief this year is staging the emergency modules at health facilities in every Southeastern and Gulf Coast state from Virginia to Texas, as well as in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Saipan.  Internationally, Direct Relief is prepositioning the modules throughout Central America and the Caribbean, including in Anguilla, the Bahamas, Barbados, British Virgin Islands, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Panama, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, as well as in Bangladesh, Fiji, and India.  **Increasing Health Infrastructure Resilience**  Where hurricanes go, power outages follow. Most notably, in 2017's Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico went dark for months.  Much of the island's temperature-sensitive medication spoiled, electronic health records were inaccessible, essential medical equipment was inoperable, and vital health services ceased. Hurricane Maria proved that power is a prerequisite for health.  With the increase of climate change-driven disasters, building resilient health infrastructure has become a core element of Direct Relief's response activities. The organization has installed solar power arrays and battery backup systems at community health centers across the U.S.  In Puerto Rico, Direct Relief, with support from [AbbVie]( ) and others, is equipping health facilities with [1.2 megawatts of solar production capacity]( ) and 2.6 megawatts of battery storage.  Projects include:  -   outfitting 89 health centers across the island with 164 FDA-compliant pharmaceutical and laboratory refrigerators and freezers capable of storing roughly 6 million vials of vaccines -   furnishing [22 community water pumps]( ) with backup solar and battery storage -   installing full backup solar power and battery storage on a fire station that lost grid power for months -   and providing home-based generators to [32 children who depend on powered equipment to breathe]( ) and for other medical needs.  **Data-Driven Disaster Preparation**  Whether responding to storms, fires, or disease outbreaks, data increasingly guides Direct Relief's work.  Using various data sources, including the [CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index]( ) and [Facebook Disaster Maps]( ), Direct Relief can identify areas at greatest risk from hurricanes, predict whether people will evacuate, and gauge the impact on local healthcare providers.  'We're increasingly able to get a real-time, high-resolution view of evacuation dynamics, medical needs, and the pressure placed on healthcare infrastructure,' said Andrew Schroeder, Direct Relief's VP of Research and Analysis.  Direct Relief is also looking at long-term displacement of people whose livelihoods have been destroyed by hurricanes, such as those in parts of Central America hit sequentially last year by Hurricanes Eta and Iota. 'There's a geography to poverty that corresponds with physical risk,' Schroeder said.  **Covid-19 + Summertime Disasters: Why This Year May Be Different**  This hurricane and wildfire season is the second to overlap with the Covid-19 pandemic. While disease prevalence in the U.S. is down sharply from its 2020 peak, the summer of 2021 presents an additional challenge.  Last year, emergency management agencies and aid groups could maintain social distancing by relocating disaster evacuees into hotels and motels, largely empty due to the steep drop in domestic travel.  This summer, with travel rebounding sharply, those rooms will no longer be available, making it more challenging to safely shelter evacuees.","['Epidemic', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Tropical Cyclone']","['Disaster Management', 'Health']","['Anguilla', 'Bahamas', 'Bangladesh', 'Barbados', 'British Virgin Islands', 'Dominica', 'Dominican Republic', 'Fiji', 'Haiti', 'Honduras', 'India', 'Jamaica', 'Panama', 'Puerto Rico (The United States of America)', 'Saint Lucia', 'Saint Vincent and the Grenadines', 'United States of America', 'World']",News and Press Release

3897677,"GA/DIS/3692   SEVENTY-SEVENTH SESSION, 13TH & 14TH MEETINGS (AM & PM)  **Israel Cites Non-Compliance as Basis for Rejecting Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone**  No United Nations Member State was too big to disarm on its own and none too small to make a contribution, the First Committee (Disarmament and International Security) was told today as it concluded its thematic debate on nuclear weapons and began consideration of other weapons of mass destruction.  The representative of Namibia said that, despite the complementarity of disarmament treaties, the concepts of prohibition and elimination should not be confused.  While prohibition of nuclear weapons was an essential foundation for their total elimination, the former should not be 'held hostage' by the latter.  She spotlighted the spike in spending by nuclear-armed States to modernize, upgrade, refurbish and extend the lives of those weapons.  Kiribati's representative expressed profound concern about the qualitative and quantitative advancements of nuclear arsenals and the exorbitant spending on those programmes.  Kiribati had endured years of nuclear-weapons tests.  Having lost many to illness as a result of that tragic legacy, he was standing up to the Goliaths of the world and declaring that enough was enough.  It was high time for the international community to recognize its complicity in allowing nuclear testing in the Pacific for decades and to provide assistance to its people.  The 'divided house' of nuclear-weapon States needed urgent action, restraint and leadership, said Brazil's representative.  These were unprecedented times, with nuclear threats and rhetoric increasing and reversing what should be a downward trend.  During the recent review of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), Brazil had agreed to 'scale back its ambition', but non-nuclear-weapon States could not keep the non-proliferation regime going on their own.  Inaction was not an option.  'One hundred seconds to midnight is indeed a very short time.'  Several countries of the Middle East reiterated their long-time call for the establishment of a regional zone free of nuclear and other mass‑destruction weapons.  Egypt's representative urged immediate action to face the strategic imbalance in the region and highlighted the persistence of one State to impede those efforts.  That, he said, hampered security and stability and led to more conflicts, an arms race and lack of sustainable peace.  The observer for the State of Palestine said Israel considered itself above the law, while everyone else must abide by the rules.  That exception was a threat to the region.  He noted the success of the first session in November 2019 of a conference to establish the Middle East zone and its adoption of substantive documents.  He described the framework as allowing the participation of all parties who took decisions by consensus.  Only one party — Israel — had decided to boycott the conference, given its desire to continue to possess nuclear weapons illegally.  The representative of Israel said any regime was only as effective as its members' compliance.  Four out of five cases of non-compliance with the NPT were in his region.  The Treaty did not provide a remedy for the Middle East's unique security situation, let alone for its repeated violations.  Some regional actors posited that the region's security architecture could be established without Israel, but that was untenable.  Regional security frameworks could only be the outcome of mutual political desire.  Anything but that could not serve as a basis for discourse on a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East.  Also speaking on nuclear weapons were representatives of Kazakhstan, Peru, Bulgaria, Republic of Korea, Ecuador, Guatemala, Armenia, El Salvador, Türkiye, Japan, Nepal, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Kuwait, Jordan, Ethiopia, Qatar, Colombia, Viet Nam, Morocco, Cuba, Finland, Saudi Arabia, Myanmar, Paraguay, Chile, Belarus and the United Arab Emirates.  The Permanent Observer for the Holy Sea and the representative of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) also addressed the Committee.  Exercising the right of reply on the topic were representatives of the Russian Federation, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Iran, Syria, Republic of Korea, Japan and Israel, as well as the European Union, in its capacity as observer.  Speaking on the theme of other weapons of mass destruction were the representatives of Indonesia (on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement), Belize (on behalf of Caribbean Community (CARICOM)), Lao Democratic People's Republic (on behalf of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)), Iraq (on behalf of the Arab Group), Russian Federation (on behalf of several countries), Canada, Indonesia (in its national capacity), France, United States, New Zealand, Australia, Netherlands, Poland, Norway, Italy, Philippines, Thailand, South Africa, Austria, Germany and Malaysia, as well as the European Union, in its capacity as observer.  Exercising the right of reply on other weapons of mass destruction were representatives of the United States, Russian Federation and Syria.  The Committee will meet again at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, 19 October, to continue its thematic discussion on other weapons of mass destruction.  **Nuclear Weapons**  ZHANGELDY SYRYMBET (Kazakhstan) said that the threat of nuclear weapons was potentially more deadly that the coronavirus and had persisted, unabated, since 1945.  Reliance on nuclear arsenals could never ensure strategic security, but only prompt asymmetric and devastating responses, thus crossing lines of no return.  He warned of cyberattacks against nuclear '3C' systems and weapons falling into terrorist hands.  The promotion of confidence-building measures was imperative as was strengthening existing measures and facilitating new nuclear‑weapon-free zones, in particular in the Middle East, North-East Asia and Europe.  The entry into force of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons was a milestone. This year, his country had suffered directly from nuclear testing. It would co-chair the informal working group on victim assistance, environmental remediation and international cooperation and assistance.  He underlined that the failure of the tenth Review Conference did not doom the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as a whole.  He urged Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) Annex II States to ratify immediately as collective action was owed to the millions of testing victims and future generations.  Humanity could not continue living 'under the dark shadow of nuclear warfare'.  It was time to overcome nuclear tests and threats and seek new horizons of peace, progress and prosperity.  SARA ALVARADO (Peru) stated that the question of global security could not be the reason for the lack of progress and even regression in disarmament and non-proliferation.  Now, more than ever, it should serve to reiterate the need for urgent action towards the total elimination of weapons of mass destruction.  It was deplorable that amid even greater challenges, threats of nuclear war were growing.  The only guarantee to avoid the humanitarian consequences of a nuclear disaster would be complete elimination.  The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons was the right path forward.  She also called for a ban on nuclear tests.  Those were crucial measures to prevent both horizontal and vertical nuclear proliferation, and an essential part of the international system nuclear non-proliferation system.  All States benefited from the peaceful use of nuclear energy, for which progress was needed on exchange of material and technology, to aid developing countries in such areas as food security, the protection of the environment and others, which directly contribute to their social and economic development.  LACHEZARA STOEVA (Bulgaria), aligning with the European Union, said that the Russian Federation's illegal war, its irresponsible nuclear rhetoric and blatant violations of the Budapest Memorandum, had undermined reduction of nuclear arsenals since the cold war.  The need for progress was more evident than ever.  Nuclear disarmament should be effective, verifiable and irreversible, and attained within the NPT framework.  She regretted the Russian Federation's blocking of the Tenth Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference outcome text, but said the draft represented  many points of convergence.  The CTBT was a building block in the construction of a world without nuclear weapons, and she called on all States, in particular the Annex II States, to ratify it.  Negotiations for a fissile material cut-off treaty were another priority.  All States, meanwhile, should abide by a moratorium on the material's production for nuclear weapons.  Effective multilateral disarmament verification was another pragmatic building block.  The safety and security of nuclear facilities was crucial for peaceful nuclear energy development.  She strongly condemned the Russian Federation's illegal seizures of Ukrainian nuclear power facilities and called for the implementation of the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) seven pillars of nuclear security and safety.  The only guarantee for the plants' security, however, was the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Russian troops.  Mr. DAMICO (Brazil) said the international community was experiencing unprecedented times, with nuclear threats and rhetoric increasing, thereby reversing what should be a downward trend.  The past two NPT Review Conferences had not produced a consensus outcome, he stressed, noting the tendency in the Committee was confrontation, with the introduction of a large number of draft resolutions.  He recalled that during the tenth Review Conference, his delegation agreed to scaling back its ambition to sustain the nuclear non-proliferation regime, but non-nuclear-weapon States could not keep the regime going on their own.  The shortening of the review cycle was the right choice, as inaction was not an option.  The divided house of nuclear-weapon States needed urgent action, with restraint and leadership, and bad examples avoided.  'One hundred seconds to midnight is indeed a very short time,' he stressed.  SUNGHOON KIM (Republic of Korea) said that, with the nuclear threat of the Russian Federation, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's continued provocation and the stalemate over Iran's nuclear programme, prospects for nuclear disarmament were bleak.  The January Joint Statement had faded amid the subsequent war.  The tenth NPT Review Conference also had failed, owing to one country's objection to consensus on an outcome document.  It was important to note, however, that there had been broad support in the draft for key elements of the Treaty's three pillars.  He noted that 79 States parties had expressed deep concern over the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's violations of Security Council resolutions, and 191 States parties had condemned the country's six nuclear-weapon tests.  It was deplorable that it continued to launch ballistic missiles and threaten tactical nuclear-weapon use.  Should the international community fail to rein in Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions, the crack would surely widen, potentially drawing others into the nuclear pit.  The tall order of realizing a world without nuclear weapons required effective multilateralism, and he called on the Council's permanent members to translate their Joint Statement into concrete action.  He urged the start of negotiations for a fissile material ban, as well as for bridge-building initiatives to close the perception gap and mistrust between States.  Negative security assurances could contribute to nuclear non-proliferation as they reduced incentives for acquiring those weapons.  Those assurances, however, should be applied only to those who faithfully complied with the NPT.   ANDRÉS FERNANDO PIEDRA CALDERÓN (Ecuador) said that with the persistent age-old risk of nuclear weapons, their non-proliferation must be incentivized.  Their disarmament and non-proliferation should advance in tandem.  The world should continue seeking a peaceful and prosperous global order without nuclear weapons.  Yet, huge budgets were earmarked for the development and modernization of those weapons, while other global challenges affected humanity such as hunger, poverty, and climate change.  He urged all States to deploy efforts to consolidate nuclear-weapon-free zones around the world.  He reminded all of the first special session of the General Assembly dedicated to disarmament in 1978.  Its outcome document had established effective measures for nuclear disarmament and the prevention of nuclear war as the highest priority.  In light of the threat currently hanging over the planet, it was time to once again echo that call.  Good would vanquish evil, he said.  MARÍA DEL ROSARIO ESTRADA GIRÓN (Guatemala) regretted that more than 50 years after the NPT's adoption, States parties had once again been unable to reach consensus on a final document, while the international context obliged the international community to seek solutions for the future of civilization.  Outstanding commitments under the Treaty's article VI remained.  She welcomed the holding of the first two sessions of the Conference for the creation of a Middle East zone free of nuclear weapons and hoped that the third session scheduled for mid-November would advance the pursuit.  She condemned all types of nuclear-weapons tests, and called on the eight countries in the CTBT's Annex II whose ratification was needed for its entry into force to adhere to it as soon as possible.  She also urged progress on a fissile material cut-off treaty to prohibit the production of that material for nuclear weapons and guarantee the disposal of such stockpiles.  DAVIT GRIGORYAN (Armenia) reiterated his support for a world free of nuclear weapons with the NPT as the cornerstone of the international security, which was designed to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and promote the peaceful use of nuclear technology.  He called for all remaining States to join as non-nuclear-weapon States.  He regretted that no consensus had been reached at the tenth NPT Review Conference but looked forward to achieving progress in the new cycle.  Dialogue among nuclear-weapon States played an important role.  He welcomed the New START extension and urged more efforts in the field of nuclear disarmament verification and confidence-building.  Armenia would continue to support the CTBT and called for the start of fissile material cut-off negotiations.  Nuclear-weapon-free zones were important regional approaches, and he supported such a zone in the Middle East.  He expressed his full compliance with IAEA Safeguards Agreements and Protocol and noted the recent visit of the Agency's Director General to Armenia.  The Armenian nuclear power plant had implemented several projects based on IAEA recommendations.  In that context, he called for a treaty on the physical protection of nuclear power plants for peaceful use.  EGRISELDA ARACELY GONZÁLEZ LÓPEZ (El Salvador) noted that the tenth NPT Review Conference had failed to adopt a final document after four weeks of intense debate, for the second consecutive time.  The outcome document was not perfect, but it set a delicate balance in a complex international situation.  El Salvador was party to several international instruments that strengthened the global nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime.  She urged all CTBT Annex II countries to ratify the Treaty to enable it to enter force as soon as possible.  She emphasized the importance of gender equality in efforts towards nuclear disarmament, also highlighting the contributions of civil society, non-governmental organizations and academia in the tireless work on the issue.  MEMET MELVUT YAKUT (Türkiye) lamented that, after four weeks of intensive negotiations, the tenth NPT Review Conference had been unable to agree on a final outcome document.  It had not been perfect, but it contained many valuable elements that reaffirmed the importance and validity of previous commitments and set out forward-looking steps to better implement the Treaty.  Its emphasis on transparency and reporting measures, as well as nuclear risk reduction, represented building blocks for much needed progress towards the ultimate goal of a world free of nuclear weapons.  He reiterated his support for a systematic, progressive, verifiable and irreversible nuclear disarmament that was based on the principle of undiminished security for all and highlighted the special responsibility of nuclear-weapon States in that pursuit.  He encouraged them to take steps to further reduce their nuclear arsenals, and achieve greater transparency and dialogue with regard to their nuclear and security policies and doctrines.  OGASAWARA ICHIRO (Japan) said that, 77 years since the Nagasaki and Hiroshima bombings, the Russian Federation had made the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons an uphill struggle.  He called on the international community to ensure that nuclear weapons were never used again, and to refrain from inflammatory language.  President Vladimir V. Putin's speech contradicted the January Joint Statement.  Japan urged nuclear-armed States, in particular the Russian Federation, to honour, not only with words, but with deeds, their crucial commitments.  He underlined the urgent need to revitalize nuclear disarmament momentum.  Japan submitted a new draft resolution on a common road map towards a world without nuclear weapons, following the Hiroshima Action Plan, as introduced at the NPT Review Conference.  The draft resolution proposed robust actions.  He hoped for the widest possible support to gain new momentum for nuclear disarmament.  He condemned the recent Democratic People's Republic of Korea's ballistic missile launches and called on all Member States to reaffirm their strong commitment to a Democratic People's Republic of Korea free of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, in accordance with Council resolutions.  AMRIT BAHADUR RAI (Nepal) said that threats of nuclear weapons use was at its highest in 77 years.  A few powerful countries kept accumulating and modernizing an astounding number of those weapons contrary to their nuclear disarmament commitment.  The world had witnessed extraordinary expenditures under the notion of nuclear deterrence when it was in desperate need of resources to tackle dehumanizing poverty, hunger, disease, and environmental catastrophe.  Humanity was an inch away from the miscalculation or escalation of nuclear war.  The global community deserved enduring peace and prosperity, not the dark shadow of the persistent threat of nuclear annihilation.  He reaffirmed Nepal's position that universal peace and security could only be ensured through the time-bound, general, and complete disarmament of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction.  Total elimination of nuclear weapons was the only solution.  The nuclear-armed States should respect the principles of transparency, irreversibility and verifiability.  ANOUPARB VONGNORKEO (Lao People's Democratic Republic), aligning with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Non-Aligned Movement, called for the total elimination of all nuclear weapons as the only way to guarantee they would never be used.  Citing the NPT, he expressed regret over the failure of the tenth Review Conference, and called on all States parties to renew their commitments.  His country was firmly committed to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and welcomed the success of the first meeting of States parties in Vienna, which had resulted in the adoption of a Political Declaration and the Vienna Plan of Action.  That would guide the Treaty's implementation and lay the foundations for a world free of nuclear weapons.  As a party to the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty, he stressed that the establishment of regional zones had contributed greatly to global disarmament.  He recognized IAEA's significant role in non-proliferation and the peaceful use of nuclear technology.  AHMAD SALMEEN (Kuwait) said that the world was facing an extremely difficult challenge, which required full efforts to rid humanity of nuclear weapons.  He reiterated his position regarding disarmament and international security, and believed that stability and peace could not be achieved in the light of the spread of different types of weapons, particularly nuclear weapons.  He stressed the importance of multilateral work as the ideal means to advance disarmament and international security.  He also stressed the importance of genuine political will in support of such efforts, particularly with regard to the disarmament of nuclear and other mass-destruction weapons.  He emphasized the importance of Israel's accession to the NPT and its placement of all its nuclear facilities under the IAEA comprehensive safeguards regime, particularly since it was the only party in the region that had not acceded to the Treaty, and prevented the establishment of the nuclear-weapon-free zone there.  SULTAN ALQAISI (Jordan), associating himself with the Arab Group and Non-Aligned Movement, said that despite the consecutive failures of the Ninth and Tenth Non‑Proliferation Treaty Review Conferences, Jordan would continue to advocate for a nuclear-weapon-free world.  Emphasizing the NPT's crucial role, he urged all States parties to engage constructively at the next Review Conference, to overcome the deadlock.  He called for the full, effective, and immediate implementation of the 1995 resolution on the Middle East and invited all parties to engage actively in its establishment.  Jordan was committed to engage with all Member States to achieve its prime goal of ridding the world of nuclear weapons.  MEBRAT GIZAW TEKA (Ethiopia), pointing to the adverse impact of the pandemic, poverty and terrorism, as well as the food, fuel and energy crises, combined with geopolitical tensions, said that the multilateral system was overwhelmed.  She was concerned about the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the inadequate political will to translate words into action.  The current arms race heightened the chance of nuclear weapons falling to rogue non-State actors.  With technological advances, the threat of nuclear war increased.  The world lacked a common framework for dialogue on the peaceful use of advanced technologies.  It also lacked global partnership and leadership.  Nuclear-weapon States should demonstrate much-needed political will, without which the goal of a world without nuclear weapons would remain elusive.  If the financial resources devoted to the arms race had been spent on poverty, the current global situation would be much better.  It was high time for diplomacy, to avoid calamity.  She voiced Ethiopia's commitment to the African Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty (Pelindaba Treaty) and to the establishment of such a zone in the Middle East.  She supported IAEA's work on the verification of States' compliance with the NPT.  ALYA AHMED SAIF AL-THANI (Qatar) said that the international community was increasingly concerned with the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and the possibility of further conflicts that would raise the risk of the use of such weapons.  International efforts for full and complete disarmament and non-proliferation remained the only way to preserve international peace and security.  In order to remove all fears of those weapons, further efforts must be made to limit, control and prohibit their use, considering their excessive harm to humanity and the environment.  She stressed the importance of full compliance with all international agreements and treaties, including the NPT, and regretted the lack of an agreed outcome at the tenth Review Conference.  Conferences should continue the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East.  She reiterated the importance of international cooperation for the elimination of nuclear and other mass destruction weapons.  NOHRA MARIA QUINTERO CORREA (Colombia) called for urgent and effective measures to be taken for the total elimination of nuclear weapons.  The events of 2022 had brought the international community to the most heightened nuclear threat since the cold war and shown the fragility of nuclear deterrence in ensuring security.  She regretted that the tenth Review Conference had not led to a positive outcome, but it was essential to press ahead with the Treaty's full implementation, in particular, the disarmament pillar.  That would require timelines for the implementation of related commitments, indicators and progress reports for appropriate monitoring.  Similarly, the principles of irreversibility, verifiability and transparency must be respected in the application of all obligations.  Denouncing the fact that significant resources were still devoted to the modernization of nuclear weapons, she called for urgent action to reduce risks through renewed dialogue.  TRAN THI THANH HAI (Viet Nam), associating herself with ASEAN and the Non-Aligned Movement, reaffirmed her country's policy of supporting all efforts for non-proliferation and disarmament.  She called for doubling down to address emerging challenges, including by establishing new mechanisms to promote the reduction and control of strategic arms among the major nuclear-weapon States.  She highlighted the need for nuclear-weapon States to offer legally binding negative security assurances to non-nuclear-weapon States.  Expressing regret that the ninth and tenth NPT Review Conferences had failed to adopt a consensus outcome document, she urged all Member States, in particular, nuclear-weapon States, to commit to implementing the NPT, especially article VI.  She meanwhile hailed the success of the first Meeting of States Parties to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and the adoption of the Vienna Declaration and Plan of Action.  The universalization and early entry into force of the CTBT would be an important step towards achieving the goal of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.  MICHAL GERSTLER (Israel) said her country supported the nuclear non-proliferation regime was a member of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and contributed to the CTBT's verification regime.  She expressed concern that radioactive sources might be used to commit terrorist acts.  Recognizing the NPT's value, she said that any regime was only as effective as the level of compliance of its members. The NPT did not provide a remedy for the unique security situation in the Middle East, let alone the repeated violations of the Treaty by some of its Member States.  Four of the five cases of serious NPT violations took place in the Middle East.  Iran had been developing its illicit nuclear programme for decades.  Those developments and the accumulation of irreversible knowledge made the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action worthless now.  Iran's progress indicated that it had never given up pursuit of nuclear military prospects.  It used negotiations as a convenient tool to bide time and had avoided providing answers to the International Atomic Energy Agency regarding undeclared nuclear material activities.  Syria's undeclared nuclear activities were also worrisome.  The clandestine nuclear reactor's construction was a blatant violation of the International Atomic Energy Agency Safeguards Agreement.  If completed, the reactor would have been suited to producing plutonium for nuclear weapons.  Some regional actors claimed that security architectures in the Middle East could be established without Israel or even without recognizing Israel's right to exist, but that position was untenable.  Any regional security framework could only be the outcome of mutual political desire, while considering every security concern.  Anything but that could not serve as a base for discourse on a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East.  Israel would not participate in artificial processes that bypassed established practices.  YOUSSEF EL MEZOUAGHI (Morocco), associating with the Arab Group, the African Group and the Non-Aligned Movement, called for the universalization of the CTBT and for the start of negotiations on a multilateral treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons.  Emphasizing the importance of nuclear-weapon-free zones in promoting nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, he recalled the relevance of General Assembly decision A/73/546 and the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference resolution calling for the establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction.  He commended the quality of the first two sessions of the Conference on the establishment of such a zone, held in 2019 and 2021, and expressed hope that the third session, scheduled for mid-November, would generate satisfactory results.  Mobilization of the international community and the political will of all were the only way to rid the world of nuclear weapons.  YUSNIER ROMERO PUENTES (Cuba), associating himself with the Non-Aligned Movement, said that the United States' first use of nuclear weapons showed the need to eliminate them.  Their mere existence unjustifiably threatened humanity.  The military doctrine based on deterrence should be rejected.  The justification of the status quo should also be rejected.  The greatest priority was disarmament, he said, calling for legally binding instruments to provide irreversible safeguards to non-nuclear-weapon States, like Cuba.  Progress was needed towards a complete ban on nuclear testing.  The inability to reach an outcome at the Tenth Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference undermined the Treaty and impeded the goal of ridding the world of nuclear weapons.  He supported a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East and was proud to be part of the first such zone in a densely populated area.  He reiterated his support for a comprehensive plan with Iran, while condemning unilateral coercive measures that infringed on States' right to use atomic energy for peaceful ends.  He also condemned the United States' illegal blockade of Cuba.  States should refrain from actions threatening the Korean Peninsula's stability and reject external interference in that region.  Only through dialogue could the world achieve satisfactory outcomes.  Citing the words of Fidel Castro, he said the world had had enough of the illusion that peace could be accomplished through nuclear weapons.  Bombs might kill the starving, but they couldn't kill hunger or starvation.  SANNA LEENA ORAVA (Finland) said that disarmament was a gradual process that required the attention of all States, taking into account their legitimate security concerns.  Nuclear disarmament was foremost the responsibility of the nuclear-armed States, but it was a concern for all nations.  The Russian Federation's war and nuclear threats undermined global nuclear disarmament efforts.  The failure of the Tenth Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference was a reflection of the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine, and not a failure of the NPT itself.  It was high time for nuclear-weapon States to make good on their NPT commitments.  The world and its people did not need a nuclear arms race.  She welcomed the New START extension, while expressing concern about the Chinese nuclear build-up.  All nuclear-weapon States must implement agreed commitments, decrease their nuclear arsenals, address non-strategic nuclear-weapon arms control and enhance negative security assurances.  Nuclear risk reduction included measures ranging from political declarations to technical crisis communication.  Risk reduction did not substitute nuclear disarmament, however, but could advance it, while global cooperation could help close loopholes to nuclear weapons use.  Advancing nuclear disarmament and reaching nuclear zero required political will.  Going forward and avoiding backtracking was more important than knowing the exact time of arrival.  NOUF UTHMAN S. ALKHALIFI (Saudi Arabia) firmly believed in the importance of the NPT and in the achievement of balance between its three pillars.  He reaffirmed the importance of international efforts aimed at the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.  All Member States should accede to all legal treaties and adhere to the moral imperatives of ridding the world of nuclear weapons.  Peace and security would not be achieved with their acquisition.  Rather, cooperation and dialogue were the basis of stability and confidence.  Development and progress could only be achieved through the avoidance of a nuclear arms race, which would reflect positively on the reduction of the risk of the threat of war and its outbreak.  The representative reaffirmed support for the international efforts aimed at empowering women in the field of nuclear disarmament and the goal of achieving gender balance in that field.  Saudi Arabia had taken practical steps to support the employment of professionally competent Saudi women in disarmament as well as in peacekeeping missions.  KYAW MOE TUN (Myanmar), associating with ASEAN and the Non-Aligned Movement, stressed that nuclear threats risked the existence of humankind, which was why it was paramount to reaffirm faith in the Committee and redouble efforts on nuclear disarmament.  He shared disappointment at the failure of the tenth NPT Review Conference to have reached consensus on a final document, and called on all nuclear-weapon States to fully implement their Treaty obligations.  He urged the relevant States parties to work towards the commencement of negotiations on a fissile material cut-off treaty.  As a State party to the Southeast Asia Nuclear-Weapons-Free Zone, Myanmar fully agreed that the establishment of such zones  contributed to nuclear disarmament.  He urged the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to respect all relevant Security Council resolutions.  Citing the illegal military coup in his country in February 2021, he called for strict observance of the junta, which recently signed an agreement with the Russian Federation to build a small-scale nuclear power plant in the next few years, despite worsening economic conditions and the mass exodus of the educated work force.  JOSÉ EDUARDO PEREIRA SOSA (Paraguay) said his country, as part of the first densely populated nuclear-weapon-free zone, supported a strengthened non-proliferation regime and advocated for transparent and legally binding nuclear disarmament.  The existence, use or threat of use of nuclear weapons posed grave dangers to humanity and the environment.  The NPT, as the cornerstone of the disarmament regime, as well as of the peaceful use of nuclear energy, complemented the  Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, CTBT and nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties.  He urged States to accede to the NPT and all Annex II States to ratify the CTBT.  Regarding the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, he heralded the First Meeting of States Parties and the resulting Political Declaration and Action Plan.  Paraguay co-sponsored the resolution on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, CTBT and the Treaty of Tlatelolco, and called on others to join.  States had the inalienable right to the peaceful use of nuclear technology, and he recognized the important role of IAEA in that regard.  Nuclear technology and energy contributed to the health, cultural and industry sectors, and its use was a fundamental issue for Paraguay.  He also welcomed IAEA's efforts relating to overcoming the pandemic and the physical security of the power plants in Ukraine.  TEBURORO TITO (Kiribati) said that the United Kingdom and the United States devastated Kiribati when they tested 33 nuclear weapons at Christmas and Malden Islands between 1957 and 1962, providing little protection to hundreds of civilians who subsequently developed terminal radiogenic illnesses, including cancer which continued to plague the health and lives of their children and grandchildren.  The suffering at the hands of those nuclear-weapon States in the name of world peace had fully convinced the world that nuclear weapons were evil and should not be used as instruments of peace and security.  Due to his country's tragic legacy, it had committed itself to seeking nuclear justice for the impacted victims and communities.  He was dismayed by calls from certain States to be 'less emotional' when discussing nuclear weapons.  Having lost many close colleagues to illnesses caused by the testing due to the lack of adherence to nuclear disarmament commitments, he would continue to express his profound concern and worry about the qualitative and quantitative advancements and modernization of the nuclear arsenals and the exorbitant spending on those programmes.  He would continue to regard such behaviour as unfriendly, irresponsible, dangerous, heartless and inhumane.  He was standing up to the Goliaths of the world and declaring that enough was enough.  It was time for the user States to recognize their moral responsibility to help affected States.  It was also high time for the international community to recognize its complicity in allowing nuclear testing to be carried out in the Pacific for decades and to provide assistance to his people.  JORGE VIDAL (Chile) reiterated the importance of the immediate opening of negotiations for a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons, including existing stockpiles.  He called for redoubled efforts to ensure that disarmament was comprehensive and prioritized a genuine and broad multilateral debate.  Chile adhered to the principle of the indivisibility of international security, since all States — regardless of their size or power — had the responsibility to contribute to the consolidation of an international order based on multilateralism and cooperation and governed by international law, including international humanitarian law.  Concerned at the dire humanitarian and environmental consequences of the use of nuclear weapons, he noted that consensus had not been reached on an NPT outcome document at the recent Tenth Review Conference.  He underlined the educational role played by IAEA.  He supported the Agency's promotion of the use of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, underlining the added value of that technology in the fields of medicine, industry, agriculture, environment, and science.  SIARHEI MAKAREVICH (Belarus) said the hope that the end of the cold war would be based on mutual respect and cooperation, and not on conflict, had led to a false feeling of calm and comfort.  Non-proliferation and disarmament were put on the back burner.  Unprecedented escalation and disagreement between States that ignored the indivisibility of common security had now led to an armed conflict in Europe.  Decreased attention to non-proliferation and disarmament instruments and a lack of mutual trust had exacerbated control and conflict issues.  In turn, that led to risks in the nuclear sphere.  Nuclear weapons were no longer a political instrument for deterrence.  The New START extension and the January Joint Statement were responsible approaches taken by nuclear-weapon States.  Belarus supported all constructive efforts at ridding the world of nuclear weapons.  Nuclear-weapon States should decrease nuclear threats through disarmament, the CTBT should rapidly enter force, new momentum was needed for creating nuclear-weapon-free zones, and a legally binding agreement to provide non-nuclear-weapon States with guarantees against nuclear weapons use against them was imperative, as the basis for humanity's continued survival.  Mr. HADDAD (United Arab Emirates), associating with the Arab Group and Non-Aligned Movement, reiterated his commitment to maintaining international security and a world free of nuclear weapons.  He regretted the second failure to adopt a final document at the NPT Review Conference and stressed the importance of non-proliferation and disarmament conferences and the full implementation of past Review Conference's resolutions.  All States should fully commit to all international instruments on nuclear safety and security and be fully transparent in their peaceful use of nuclear energy under the NPT.  He urged full participation by all parties to the third Conference on the Establishment of a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in the Middle East.  He underlined the special responsibility of Annex II States to accede to the CTBT and the importance of the International Atomic Energy Agency's work.  States whose nuclear activities raised questions should undertake to ensure the international community's confidence in their peaceful nature.  In that, he underlined the importance of safety and transparency in his country's nuclear energy programme.   HELENA NDAPEWA KUZEE (Namibia) said that her country, among the world's largest uranium producers, did not support it for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices.  Nuclear weapons were a source of international antagonism, instilling fear and posing endless threats about the destructive force of their use. While existing treaties complemented each other, it was important not to confuse the concepts of prohibition and elimination.  The prohibition of nuclear weapons was an essential foundation for their total elimination.  The former should not be held hostage to the latter.  She remained concerned at the spending by nuclear-weapon States to modernize, upgrade, refurbish and extend the lives of their nuclear weapons and related facilities.  She believed that the continued existence and possession of those weapons did not guarantee security, but rather substantially increased the risk of their potential use.  No Member State was too big to disarm on its own, and none too small to make a contribution.  Multilateralism remained central to attaining the goal of nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and peaceful use of nuclear energy for the benefit of humanity, and was a universal inalienable right.  GABRIELE CACCIA, Permanent Observer of the Holy See, regretted that the world had been moving in the wrong direction.  Important disarmament and transparency treaties had been discarded and the disarmament machinery remained deadlocked, with no progress made toward a treaty banning the production of fissile material.  The CTBT was in a state of legal limbo despite further ratifications.  States possessing nuclear weapons were expanding and modernizing their arsenals and squandering resources that could address the world's hunger crisis and advance integral human development.  She condemned the irresponsible escalatory rhetoric.  To avoid nuclear war, all State possessors must take immediate steps to reduce the operational readiness of their nuclear forces, adopt no-first-use policies and long-term policies establishing a global ceiling on nuclear stockpiles, from which reductions could be made.  He renewed his concern regarding the 'catastrophic humanitarian and environmental effects' of nuclear weapons, adding that those were not abstract or theoretical.  The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, along with the more than 2,000 tests conducted worldwide, had shown the very real harms inflicted by nuclear weapons.  Indeed, working towards their total elimination also meant that those responsible should redress those harms.  He commended efforts aimed at fostering cooperation in nuclear disarmament verification, which would not only create a culture of trust, but also provide much needed hope that a world free of nuclear weapons was possible.  Indeed, such a world was not only possible but necessary for safeguarding the future of humanity.  QAIS Z. F. KASABRI, observer for the State of Palestine, associating with the Arab Group and the Non-Aligned Movement, voiced deep disappointment over the back-to-back failures of the Ninth and Tenth Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conferences. That stalemate could erode the credibility of the disarmament and non-proliferation regime.  The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons did not contradict the NPT, but rather complemented it and furthered achievement of its objectives.  He welcomed the convening of the first session of the conference to establish a zone free from nuclear and all other mass-destruction weapons in the Middle East in November 2019, noting its success in adopting several substantive decisions.  Reiterating that the conference was a framework that allowed the participation of all parties and took its decisions by consensus, he noted that one party — Israel — had decided to boycott it, given its desire to continue to possess nuclear weapons illegally, considering that it was above the law and that everyone must abide by the rules while it enjoyed all the exceptions that threatened the security and safety of the region.  The State of Palestine invited all countries to support the conference, including nuclear-weapon States.  VIVIAN OKEKE, representative of the Director General of theInternational Atomic Energy Agency, said IAEA sought to enlarge atomic energy's contribution to peace, health and prosperity, and ensure it was not used for military purposes.  The Agency was devoted to meet each Member State's development needs and was responsible for the peaceful use of nuclear energy, related to food and water resource management security.  Its vital contributions to international peace and security through verification and safeguard measures were aimed at independently verifying States' commitment to not divert nuclear materials to nuclear weapons or misuse technology.  It also responded to assistance requests to overcome medical emergencies, national disasters, industrial accidents and, lately, military conflicts.  She updated the Committee on the Director General's work in Ukraine and the seven pillars of nuclear safety and security of nuclear facilities.  They related to facilities' physical safety, equipment systems, the staff's ability to work free of undue pressure, logistical supply chains and transport, radiation monitoring systems, and reliable communication.  Those pillars had been compromised at Ukraine's nuclear facilities.  The Agency had undertaken three missions to Ukraine and, among other things, left behind a team of experts at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.  On 6 September, the Director General proposed a safety and security zone around the power plant and subsequently met with Presidents Vladimir V. Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy.  In closing, she said the Agency was a vehicle to spread atomic energy benefits and limit nuclear weapons proliferation.  It would continue to play a role in energy, climate and food crises.  At the Conference of the Parties in Egypt, IAEA would highlight the role of nuclear technology in climate adaptation and mitigation.  It was committed to creating a more gender-balanced workforce in the Agency and in the nuclear sector more broadly.  **Right of Reply**  The representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, and speaking in exercise of the right of reply, firmly rejected and unequivocally condemned the illegal annexation by the Russian Federation of Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia oblasts, which followed the so-called referendums.  They took place amid widespread and systematic abuses of human rights, as well as intimidation of Ukrainian citizens by the Russian Federation.  The representative did not and would never recognize that illegal annexation, just as he never recognized the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014.  Those regions were part of Ukraine.  Last week, the United Nations General Assembly sent a clear message to the Russian Federation through the adoption of the resolution, which confirmed that the overwhelming majority of nations stood ready to defend the United Nations Charter, and rejected the Russian Federation's aggressions against Ukraine and its people.  The resolution demanded that the Russian Federation immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.  By wilfully undermining the rules-based international order and blatantly and repeatedly violating Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, the Russian Federation was putting global peace and security at risk, taking territory by force.  The occupation by Russian armed forces of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and Russian military operations conducted in the vicinity of that civilian nuclear facility were unacceptable and added to the gravity of the situation.  The representative of the Russian Federation, also speaking in exercise of the right of reply, categorically rejected the accusations that were devoid of reality and had nothing to do with the current situation.  Regarding the European Union's right of reply, he said he did not see any need to provide any additional clarifications regarding the Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson referenda.  The results spoke for themselves:  the residents used their legal right to self-determination.  They deliberately chose for the Russian Federation.  They were able to make that choice freely, which had been confirmed by international monitors and was in line with the 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States, the Charter and other documents.  More comments on that topic had been given earlier.  Regarding the Russian Federation's alleged violation of the Budapest Memoranda, he said that the Memoranda were part of a package of agreements that placed equal obligations on all participants.  The Russian Federation had consistently adhered to the provisions.  However, the United States and other Western countries interfered in the internal affairs of a sovereign State, namely Ukraine, and attempted to tear it away from the Russian Federation.  Now, they interfered in all spheres, including military spheres.  They assisted in the bloody coup to ensure they controlled those in power in Kyiv.  That ramped up tensions among the Ukrainian population and threatened Ukraine's existence as a single State.  The expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) into the post-Soviet sphere, he said, undermined the Russian Federation's security and violated the Budapest Memoranda, which ensured common and inalienable security.  Over the course of many years, Kyiv did not adhere to the Budapest obligations, in particular, those that attempted to envisaged to combat chauvinism and nationalism.  Kyiv supported radical forms of that, including hero-worship of Nazi perpetrators, and that had become part of their ideology.  In turn, that forced those living in certain regions in Ukraine to defend their interests through self‑determination.  Kyiv was responsible for the deep divide in society, its destructive policies and outside influences.  The Memoranda, he went on, were signed when Ukraine signed onto the NPT as a non-nuclear-weapon State.  The Russian Federation reiterated its commitment not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon States.  But, that obligation was not fully carried out by the other sides.  The Russian Federation did not threaten Ukraine with nuclear weapons and would never do so.  Ukraine's review of its non-nuclear status would undermine the NPT.  In addition, the recent comments regarding preventative nuclear attacks against the Russian Federation were completely unacceptable.  The representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea categorically rejected the provocative statements by the Republic of Korea and Japan.  Under the current circumstances, it was important to look at the root causes of the Korean Peninsula issue.  The Republic of Korea's persistent acts of subservience to outside force and uninterrupted military provocations were the root cause.  It followed the United States' heinous hostile policy to stifle his Republic, translate it into hostile acts and aggravate the situation.  The Korean Peninsula situation was this way due to the aggressive nature of the Republic of Korea and the United States.  The hostile policies derived from the Republic of Korea's wild pipedream to obliterate his country's choice of ideology and reunify on its own terms.  Hostility brought confrontation and confrontations worsened the crisis and induced conflicts.  The current Republic of Korea's policy against his country surpassed those of previous Governments, in terms of ferocity and recklessness.  Historically, the Korean Peninsula's tensions coincided with the United States and Republic of Korea's massive military drills.  By all accounts, those drills were war drills, aimed the ability to invade the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  The sustained Republic of Korea's military drills were the root cause and damaged peace in the region.  He would watch the military moves of the hostile forces and take strong counter-steps if necessary.  Japan had transformed itself into a war-capable country, he said.  Worse still, Japan was actively involved in joint military drills with United States in the hottest areas in the world.  Japan imported a huge amount of plutonium and wanted to use it for military purposes.  The international community should be on high alert for its dangerous moves aimed at nuclear armament and re-invasion.  The representative of Iran said certain European countries that had disregarded their commitments under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action were uttering falsehoods about his State.  Sanctions remained in place, and Iran did not enjoy the economic dividends that were part of the deal.  The United States' obligation was to make good-faith efforts to maintain the deal, but in defiance of Security Council resolution 2231 (2015), withdrew on 8 May 2018 and reimposed unilateral sanctions.  While Iran maintained its commitments, a maximum pressure policy was still pursued.  The people's suffering continued and was nearly irreversible.  Iran had responded to all IAEA questions in a thorough and comprehensive manner, while Israel had done everything to scuttle the Plan of Action.  The representative of Syria, responding to Israel's delegate, rejected the accusations and lies designed to mask that State's crimes and to escape from resolutions passed against it.  While Israel possessed biological, chemical and nuclear weapons, Syria cooperated with IAEA, showing the greatest flexibility and full adherence to the global safeguards agreement.  Citing Israel's aggression of 2007 against his country, he called on that State to cooperate with IAEA on pollution generated by its missiles.  Condemning all aggression against Syria, he said the meeting was being used as a platform to attack his country. He insisted that Israel join the NPT.  The representative of the Republic of Korea said that everyone knew which country started the Korean War and which country continued to go down the path of provocations and hostile behaviours.  She drew attention to the immovable truth, that it was that one country that continued to blatantly pursue its military ambitions by launching more than 40 missiles this year alone, not to mention its new legislation to lower the threshold of using nuclear weapons.  Against that backdrop, the combined defence and deterrence posture was not only a response to such military threats, but it was a duty of a responsible Government.  She reiterated that any attempt by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to justify its possession and potential use of nuclear weapons would not be recognized by the international community under any circumstances.  As a country that consistently upheld and defended the Charter, hers believed that all Member States should abide by Security Council resolutions, without exception, she said.  The Democratic People's Republic of Korea must end all unlawful nuclear activities, which violated international law and multiple Council resolutions, by abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programmes in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner.  She also urged it to stop provocative actions and choose different paths by responding to the calls for dialogue.  The representative of Japan said his country adhered to the basic precept of maintaining the exclusively defence-oriented policy and of not becoming a military Power that posed a threat to other countries.  Japan would never change its course as a peace-loving nation.  The purpose of its defence-related expenditure was to enable its self-defence forces to carry out its duties to ensure the lives and peaceful livelihood of the Japanese people and to further to contribute to the peace and security of the international community.  Japan would continue to ensure high transparency in defence-related expenditures, he said.  With regard to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's reference to Japan's possession of plutonium, the representative highlighted that IAEA already had confirmed that all nuclear materials in Japan, including plutonium, remained in peaceful activities under stringent IAEA safeguards.  The representative of Israel said that both Iran and Syria were NPT States parties that knowingly and deliberately had and continued to violate the Treaty.  Those actors tried to destabilize the Middle East and must provide answers to IAEA.  The representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea rejected the provocative statements of the Republic of Korea and Japan.  His country had never recognized United Nations resolutions that seriously encroached on its sovereignty and its right to develop and exist.  The Republic of Korea tried to distort the nature of the Korean Peninsula's issues.  From August to October, it had frantically conducted joint drills, sought to conduct massive military drills, and had committed serious provocations.  In response, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's military sent a strong warning to the hostile forces.  The conservative Government of the Republic of Korea must admit that it had overstepped, and he urged it to think about how its actions might invite danger to itself.  He said that Japan's bottom line was to introduce a long-distance strike missile.  That ran counter to it exclusive defensive policy, as stipulated in the Japanese Constitution.  Japanese policymakers were arguing about introducing nuclear‑sharing with the United States.  He urged them to reflect on their military moves that might invite undesired effects.  The representative of Iran rejected the unacceptable statement by Israel's delegate and said he would not provide any further answers.  The representative of Japan said his country would continue to contribute to peace and security of the Asian region and the world.  His Government adhered to non-nuclear principles and would not possess nuclear weapons.  **Weapons of Mass Destruction**  MOHAMMAD KURNIADI KOBA (Indonesia), speaking on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, said that non-fulfilment of the commitments and obligations assumed under international legally binding instruments, especially on weapons of mass destruction, threatened global peace and security.  The Movement's States parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons (Convention on Chemical Weapons) urged the United States to take every necessary measure to ensure its compliance with the 'Detailed plan for the destruction of Chemical Weapons remaining after the final extended destruction deadline of 29 April 2012'.  The use of chemical weapons and toxic chemicals as weapons anywhere by anyone under any circumstances was reprehensible and completely contrary to international law and the Convention.  Those responsible for the use of chemical weapons should be held accountable.  He reiterated his condemnation of Israeli military aggression against the Gaza Strip in 2009, and July 2014 and August 2014, and the occupying Power's indiscriminate shelling and bombing of Palestinian civilian areas.  He was gravely concerned about the reported use in civilian areas of harmful and potentially fatal incendiary weapons, such as white phosphorus, and he reiterated the call for a thorough investigation.  International support to victims suffering from chemical weapons exposure was an urgent humanitarian need.  Actions by the Security Council should not undermine the United Nations Charter, existing multilateral treaties on weapons of mass destruction, international organizations established in that regard or the General Assembly's functions, power and role.  He cautioned against the Council's ongoing practice to utilize its authority to define legislative requirements for Member State.  The Movement would present a draft resolution on measures to uphold the authority of the 1925 Geneva Protocol.  CARLOS FULLER (Belize), speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and associating with the Non-Aligned Movement, said that international peace and security affected all.  The Caribbean Community was concerned that the world was no closer to eliminating nuclear and other mass destruction weapons.  Chemical weapons use was unjustifiable.  He reiterated his support for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and the Chemical Weapons Convention.  That treaty had made great contributions in codifying a universal norm against chemical weapons use, which caused dire environmental, health and humanitarian consequences.  Any use must be fully investigated, those responsible must be held accountable, and victims should be assisted.  He commended the work of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in destroying stockpiles and in capacity-building.  She expressed the Caribbean Community's ongoing support for the Biological Weapons Convention and called attention to the danger of non-State actors' access to those weapons in light of the world's scientific and technologic developments.  Climate change was the greatest challenge in his region, compounded by the pandemic's socioeconomic impact.  The Caribbean Community worked on a counter-terrorism strategy in collaboration with the United Nations. The Community's commitment to the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction was unwavering, he concluded.  ANOUPARB VONGNORKEO (Lao People's Democratic Republic), speaking on behalf of ASEAN and associating with the Non-Aligned Movement, stressed that all weapons of mass destruction, used intentionally or by accident, could cause severe casualties and massive loss of life, damage to property, and significant harm to numerous species and biodiversity, and he condemned their use.  He said that all ASEAN member States were parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention and strictly abided by international obligations.  He commended the OPCW for its unwavering support of the Convention, and welcomed progress in eliminating chemical weapons stockpiles. He noted the fiftieth anniversary of the Biological Weapons Convention, but cited the lack of a verification measure, which challenged its effectiveness.  ASEAN remained committed to enhancing regional capacity to address chemical, biological and radiological threats. He spotlighted the achievements of the Network of ASEAN Chemical, Biological and Radiological Defence Experts, who shared information and best practices in order to strengthen regional preparedness and cooperation against chemical, biological and radiological threats.  Practical cooperation in the ASEAN defence sector had advanced since its inception in 2006, particularly through the ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting platform.  Moreover, the ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting-Plus Chemical, Biological and Radiological Conference, organized by Singapore, aimed to develop a deeper understanding of the risks posed by 'CBR' agents in terrorist acts in the region.  MOHAMMED HUSSEIN BAHR ALULOOM (Iraq) speaking on behalf of the Arab Group, said he adhered to its principled position of achieving a world free of nuclear and other mass destruction weapons, giving due priority to the cause of the establishing a zone free of those weapons in the Middle East.  The Arab Group played an active role in efforts aimed at eliminating weapons of mass destruction.  He affirmed that Israel's accession to the NPT would contribute to achieving its universality and boost regional and international security.  It would also enhance the credibility of the international disarmament and non-proliferation system, as Israel was the only country in the region that did not belong to any of the three arms-related treaties.  The Arab countries had agreed to expand the scope of arms control measures in the region to include other weapons of mass destruction in addition to nuclear weapons.  He reiterated the call for strengthening international efforts to establishment a zone in his region free of nuclear and other mass destruction weapons.  KONSTANTIN VORONTSOV (Russian Federation), speaking on behalf of Belarus, Venezuela, China, Zimbabwe, Cuba, Nicaragua and Syria, concluded that the questions regarding the United States' military biological activities in the context of Ukraine's laboratories remain unresolved.  He had not received explanations that would eliminate the need for the Russian Federation to conduct a meeting.  He called for States parties to the Biological Weapons Convention to continue sharing expert opinions and technical assessments and to submit their suggestions to the ninth NPT Review Conference.  Given the outcomes of the consultative meetings, and in order to facilitate the resolving issues, all  opportunities provided by the Biological Weapons Convention should be used.  The outcomes would show the Convention's potential and its efficiency.  Moreover, negotiations should resume on a legally binding, comprehensive protocol with effective verification mechanisms.  Hopefully, that decision would be adopted at the Review Conference.  Mr. KARCZMARZ, representative of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, condemned the Russian Federation's ongoing war against Ukraine.  The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction was a grave threat to international peace and security, including the risk of terrorist acquisition.  The Union welcomed the successful and verified destruction of 99 per cent of the declared chemical weapons stockpiles.  Chemical weapons use was always a violation of international law and could amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.  The world had witnessed their horrific use in Syria, the United Kingdom, the Russian Federation and Malaysia.  Impunity must end and accountability be ensured.  He denounced Syria's continued violations as a State party to the Chemical Weapons Convention.  The Union remained steadfast in defending the OPCW against deliberate attacks on its integrity.  He reaffirmed the Union's support for the Biological Weapons Convention as the legally binding norm against those weapons and called on all States to join it.  Expressing deep concern regarding the Russian Federation's disinformation campaign, he underlined the unacceptability of attacking legitimate capacity-building programmes in the biosecurity domain. The Hague Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation was an integral part of the multilateral non-proliferation architecture. The Union supported all international export control regimes, including the Zangger Committee, the Australia Group, and the Wassenaar Arrangement.  BRYAN TOMLINSON (Canada) said that the legal frameworks established to ban the possession, development, and use of chemical and biological weapons were increasingly being undermined in September, States parties to the Biological Weapons Convention had met at the behest of the Russian Federation to hear baseless accusations about allegedly inappropriate biological activities conducted by the United States in Ukraine.  It had resulted in an unambiguous conclusion that activities supported by the United States in Ukraine were fully consistent with the Convention.  The allegations of the Russian Federation were baseless, disingenuous, and damaging to the Convention's integrity.  The Russian Federation manufactured and misrepresented long-standing cooperation between the United States and Ukraine and legitimately supported its disinformation charge that they violated the Convention.  He said Canada had supported many international assistance projects at biolabs in the Russian Federation, including at facilities implicated in the former Soviet Union's offensive bioweapons programme, which had involved peaceful scientific collaboration similar to that the Russian Federation called into question in Ukraine.  It also had accused Ukraine of developing chemical weapons.  The Russian Federation had gone so far as to imply that inspectors from the Organisation could be involved in staging chemical attacks in order to blame the Russian Federation.  Ukraine was in compliance with the Convention.  In stark contrast, the Russian Federation had failed to satisfactorily explain the attempted assassinations of Sergei Skripal in 2018 and Alexei Navalny in 2020.  The intent of the Russian Federation disinformation was clear: to undermine decades of collective effort to eliminate two entire categories of weapons of mass destruction.  NARA MASISTA RAKHMATIA (Indonesia), speaking in her national capacity and associating herself with ASEAN and the Non-Aligned Movement, stressed that the use of all weapons of mass destruction by anyone, anywhere and under any circumstances was inhumane, morally disgraceful and legally unacceptable.  The Convention on Chemical Weapons was one of the most successful multilateral instruments in disarmament and non-proliferation.  However, the threats to international peace and security from their use were clear, and the only guarantee against them was those weapons' complete elimination.  As a top priority, the remaining possessor countries must expedite the total destruction of their stockpiles, of all categories of chemical weapons, before the deadlines, under strict verification.  She also maintained Indonesia's unequivocal commitment to upholding the norms against biological weapons.  MOHAMED KAMAL ALI ELHOMOSANY (Egypt), associating with the Arab Group and the Non-Aligned Movement, said he had joined consensus on the indefinite extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1995 on the understanding that the package included a resolution to establish a Middle East nuclear-weapon-free zone.  His was the first country in the region to propose including other weapons of mass destruction in that zone.  He called for immediate action to face the strategic imbalance in the Middle East, owing to the persistence of one State to impede the efforts of establishing the zone.  Such persistence impeded regional security and stability and led to more conflicts, an arms race, instability, international intervention and a lack of sustainable peace.  Condemning any use of weapons of mass destruction by any side under any circumstances, he highlighted once more the double standards in the position expressed by some Member States when they called on certain Member States by name to accede to the Chemical and Biological Weapons Conventions, while not calling on the only Member State in the Middle East that was a non-State party to the NPT to join it without delay.  The security of some Member States was not more important than that of others.  CAMILLE PETIT (France) said that compliance with the norms of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction by all States was an imperative.  Trivialization of proliferation crises and impunity should be rejected.  The taboo against the use of chemical weapons, which was thought to be inviolable, had been broken on several occasions: in Syria, the Russian Federation, Malaysia, and the United Kingdom.  Syria should comply with its international obligations if it was to restore its rights and privileges that were suspended by the decision of the Conference of States Parties in April 2021.  The assassination attempt against Alexei Navalny in August 2020 using a nerve agent belonging to the ""Novitchok"" family, as confirmed by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, was another illustration of the use of a chemical weapon by a State party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, namely, the Russian Federation.  She strongly reiterated the use of chemical weapons wherever, whenever, by whomever and under whatever circumstances.  SCOTT TURNER (United States) said the international community must remain resolute to reverse the trend of chemical weapons use.  There could be no impunity.  The Assad regime had failed in its obligations by using chemical weapons against its own people.  OPCW had attributed four separate chemical weapons attacks to that regime.  On a point of order, the representative of Syria drew attention to the need to use diplomatic language as well as official names of countries and to respect the rules of intervention adopted by this Organization.  The representative of the United States reaffirmed its condemnation of the Russian Federation's poisoning of Alexei Navalny and urged that country to answer the international community's questions in that case, as well as in regard to the case of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, United Kingdom.  The Russian Federation must declare its chemical weapons programme and destroy those weapons in its possession.  Relating to its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the Russian Federation claimed that Ukrainian troops had used chemical weapons but had provided no evidence.  The Biological Weapons Convention solidified the view that States parties must exclude biological weapons.  The world was at a momentous crossroads.  The pandemic reminded the world how vulnerable it was to infectious diseases.  All biological threats, natural or otherwise, should be taken seriously and required cooperation.  Some sought to undermine that Convention, but the world could not allow progress to elude it, and a new course should be charted at the upcoming Review Conference.  Biological weapons were unacceptable, and he called on all States to come together for the sake of mankind.  He would address the Russian Federation's unfounded allegation against the United Nations and Ukraine in his right of reply.  ERIN MORRISS (New Zealand) expressed concern over proven cases of chemical weapons use, which were an affront to the global rules and norms to the world had collectively committed to preserve and defend.  Those reinforced support for the critical work of Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).  She underlined her commitment to the International Partnership against Impunity for the Use of Chemical Weapons and its work the work it did to hold to account those who dared to use those repugnant weapons, urging the Russian Federation to cooperate fully with the international community and OPCW to provide answers regarding the poisoning of Alexei Navalny.  She also reminded Syria of its obligations following the adoption of the decision Addressing the Possession and Use of Chemical Weapons by that country.  Additionally, she urged it to comply with the decision of the Conference of States Parties without delay.  Turning to biological weapons, she noted the upcoming ninth Review Conference of the Biological Weapons Convention, and said it was a timely opportunity to strengthen that important element of the global disarmament and non-proliferation architecture.  RUTH HILL (Australia) said that it was time to rid the world of chemical weapons, once and for all.  Despite progress, those weapons continued to pose a persistent threat.  She underscored her strong support for OPCW and commended it for its professionalism, impartiality and integrity.  Australia supported its ability to respond to chemical weapons use and to hold to accountable the users and those who commanded, enabled or shielded them.  It was imperative for Syria to comply with its obligations under that Convention and ensure the complete dismantlement and destruction of its chemical weapons.  She said that biological threats did not respect State borders.  Use of biological weapons anywhere would be globally disruptive and have a severe impact upon all.  In the fiftieth anniversary since the opening for signature of the Convention, a recommitment was needed to rid the world of those weapons.  She called out those who spread disinformation about those and chemical weapons and who sought to abuse the mechanisms of those Conventions and undermine the work of the OPCW.  She was greatly concerned by the Russian Federation's unsubstantiated claims about chemical and biological weapons, including against Ukraine and the United States, and she urged it to cease.  ROBERT IN DEN BOSCH (Netherlands), aligning with the European Union, said that the world would witness the complete construction of all declared stockpiles in one more year.  That unique achievement had been made possible by OPWC's years‑long efforts.  However, there was a disturbing reemergence of that threat, with Syria's use of chemical weapons against its own population.  The Russian Federation started a disinformation campaign with unfounded claims of Ukrainian chemical weapons use.  To ensure the work of OPWC, he called for all Member States to vote in favor of the upcoming budget proposal.  As the pandemic illustrated, it mattered little whether pathogens were spread deliberately or naturally.  Diseases did not respect international borders.  The world community should take steps to address those threats.  The Netherlands would continue to take concrete steps to improve biosafety.  He underscored the importance the Secretary-General's mechanism for investigation and drew attention to the often-overlooked gendered impact, which could enhance progress in that field.  PIOTR DZWONEK (Poland), associating with the European Union, said the Russian Federation's unjustifiable, unprovoked and illegal war of aggression against Ukraine has grossly violated the Charter, undermined global security and the rules-based international order, bringing devastating consequences for the entire world.  'Our message should remain strong and clear — we will continue to stand together to preserve the international standards and norms against the use of chemical weapons,' he stressed.  All perpetrators of those crimes should be held accountable.  Today, more than ever, the international community needs to convey a powerful and unambiguous signal of support for the Chemical Weapons Convention, as well as for OPCW leadership and its staff in their efforts aimed at promoting the Convention's full implementation, with strong verification of that compliance.  As before, Poland had been making best efforts to organize an open, inclusive and transparent process of preparing the updated text of the resolution, and wherever possible, preserving the agreed language of the resolution, adding only a few new elements necessary to maintain its relevance.  ODD-INGE KVALHEIM (Norway) said the global conventions to prohibit chemical and biological weapons were foundational pillars in the world's non-proliferation architecture.  The world could not allow them to be eroded by blatant violations, nor become areas for false accusations.  Referring to the Russian Federation's allegations of Ukraine's biological weapons programme, he said it was intolerable to use that to assail international assistance.  Cross-border cooperation was crucial in strengthening resilience to biological threats, and it was imperative to speak out against attempts to falsely frame peaceful cooperation as a form of non-compliance.  He firmly rejected all efforts to discredit the important work of the OPCW Technical Secretariat and its Director General.  He said that Syria was failing to close its 20 outstanding issues, and he supported suspension of its rights and privileges.  The Russian Federation should investigate Alexei Navalny's poisoning, share the findings with States parties to the Chemical Weapons Convention and bring those responsible to justice.  Norway had joined the European Union in sanctioning the Russian Federation and that ban included chemical‑weapons exports.  The Secretary-General's mechanism for the investigation of alleged uses must remain independent and impartial, and Norway saw no reason to update its procedures as proposed in the related resolution.  Compliance was key to upholding the strength of the conventions. Practical ways must be sought to provide assistance.  That would require strong partnership with civil society, the private sector and others.  He introduced a draft resolution on the Secretary-General's mechanism for investigating alleged use of chemical and biological weapons (document A/C.1/77/L.69).  TANCREDI FRANCESE (Italy) said that securing sensitive materials, especially from terrorist networks' acquisition and implementing effective export controls remained major challenges.  Those highlighted the need for the universal and effective implementation of the Chemical and Biological Weapons Conventions.  The COVID-19 pandemic had shown how important it was to work together to improve global biosecurity and biosafety.  In that regard, the Biological Weapons Convention was paramount, and every possible effort should be made to strengthen its regime and ensure its full and effective implementation.  Dialogue and flexibility were more essential than ever.  He was deeply concerned by the repeated use of chemical weapons.  In the strongest possible terms, he condemned their use by anyone, anywhere, anytime and under any circumstances.  The world must respond to that alarming trend by ensuring accountability and taking a clear stance against impunity for such heinous crimes.  He firmly condemned the use of chemical weapons by Syria and urged it to take all measures required to resolve the pending issues.  He reiterated his call on the Russian Federation to disclose without further delay the circumstances of the assassination attempt on Alexei Navalny.  Moreover, in the context of its war of aggression against Ukraine, the Russian Federation engaged in a campaign of disinformation, spreading unsubstantiated allegations against Ukraine and others regarding chemical weapons.  Ukraine was a responsible member of the Chemical Weapons Convention and in full compliance with it.  ARIEL RODELAS PENARANDA (Philippines), associating with the Non-Aligned Movement and ASEAN, said that no aspiration or ambition could justify the use of weapons of mass destruction.  These 'weapons of death' put everyone at mortal risk, especially if they fell in terrorists' hands.  The Philippines remained committed to upholding the global governance structure and emphasized the need for strategic trade management to reinforce global non-proliferation norms.  It participated in all processes aimed at implementing the relevant Conventions.  Expressing full commitment to Security Council resolution 1540 (2004), he said that the world benefitted from multilateral export control regimes.  Weapons of mass destruction, their means of delivery, equipment and technology were becoming more sophisticated.  National strategic trade control should respond to evolving security threats, and multilateral export control regimes should remain technically driven and insulated from politicization.  Further, politically driven unilateral measures should not unduly restrain international cooperation on peaceful uses.  There was a space for taking further steps to unlock the synergies between the disarmament paradigm and the Sustainable Development Goals.  THARARUT HANLUMYUANG (Thailand) stressed that biological and chemical weapons should not be used by anyone, at any time and under any circumstances.  Compliance with the obligations arising from existing international instruments in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation remained the key to effective responses in the area of collective security.  She reaffirmed the importance of effective and transparent implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, calling for a strengthened Biological Weapons Convention with more effective verification mechanisms to enable rapid responses to growing global biological threats.  Thailand would continue to strengthen its export control system, border security, conduct on‑site inspections and submit annual declarations.  Given the connectivity of the single market within the ASEAN community, it was a priority to monitor dual-use goods and technology transfer, while fostering engagements with the private sector.  MATHU JOYINI (South Africa) stated that the total elimination of all weapons of mass destruction remained one of South Africa's key foreign policy priorities.  There was a collective responsibility to uphold the international norms against the production, use and stockpiling of chemical weapons established under the Convention.  He condemned the use of those by anyone, anywhere and under any circumstances.  It was imperative that States were held accountable for any non-compliance.  He supported OPCW as the only technically competent international authority in the field of chemical weapons.  He underlined the importance of capacity-building and international cooperation for the benefit of States parties through the transfer of technology, knowledge, material and equipment for peaceful purposes.  The Biological Weapons Convention was an important contribution to the maintenance of international peace and security.  He remained committed to strengthening that Convention and its implementation to ensure achievement of preventing the threat of those weapons.  ALEXANDER KMENTT (Austria), aligning with the European Union, said that his country's objective was a world free of all weapons of mass destruction as their existence threatened peace and security.  He fully supported the Chemical and Biological Weapons Conventions and called on all States to fully implement them.  He condemned any use or threat of use of any type of weapons of mass destruction and expressed concern regarding disinformation and escalation.  Syria's repeated chemical weapons use was a blatant violation of its State party obligations.  He also expressed concern regarding the use of those weapons in the Russian Federation, Malaysia and the United Kingdom, which undermined the hard-earned taboo against their use.  There could not be impunity, he said, placing full trust in OPWC.  The pandemic highlighted the need to strengthen Biological Weapons Convention's norms.  With rapid technological developments in life science, artificial intelligence and lowered barriers, security challenges were increasingly complex.  The Biological Weapons Convention should be responsive to the needs of the time, he said, pointing to the importance of verification methods, national implementation and confidence-building measures.  Austria supported the Secretary-General's mechanism.  Export control regimes were important, and The Hague Code of Conduct should be fully implemented.  THOMAS GÖBEL (Germany) said that the Russian Federation had started an unjustifiable, unprovoked and illegal war of aggression against Ukraine.  He was particularly concerned about unfounded claims against Ukraine, a country with an exemplary non-proliferation track record.  Those baseless claims were used as a pretext to justify an illegal aggression against a sovereign country in the heart of Europe.  The Russian Federation's behaviour was undermining the international arms‑control and non‑proliferation architecture.  Rapid developments in life sciences and biotechnology offered new ways to fight disease, but also posed a risk for abuse in the development of biological weapons.  He condemned the disinformation campaign by the Russian Federation, and also was concerned at Syria's continued non-compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention.  Equally concerning was the repeated use of internationally banned nerve agents, such as in the cases of Mr. Skripal and Mr. Navalny.  The Russian Federation, on whose territory the attack on Mr. Navalny had taken place more than two years ago, had not provided any explanations on the attack, nor had any criminal investigation begun.  He called on the Russian Federation to launch a substantial proble in order to answer all outstanding questions in full transparency and without further delay, and to fully cooperate with OPCW.  SYED MOHAMAD HASRIN AIDID (Malaysia), associating himself with ASEAN and the Non-Aligned Movement, reaffirmed his country's commitment to complete disarmament and the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction.  'Their very existence is a blight on the conscience of mankind,' he stressed.  Citing the importance and relevance of the Chemical Weapons Convention, he condemned the use of those weapons by any side, regardless of the circumstances, and expressed concern about their re-emergence.  It was imperative that the users be held accountable.  He urged States to cooperate with OPCW, which was mandated to investigate the use of chemical weapons.  He reiterated the call to developed countries to encourage the technology transfers for peaceful in the chemical domain, and he recalled Malaysia's support for the Biological Weapons Convention, which was a key component of the global disarmament architecture.  **Right of Reply**  The representative of the United States, speaking in exercise of the right of reply, took the floor to respond to the Russian Federation's continued efforts to malign international cooperation and assistance activities, in order to justify its unprovoked, illegal and brutal invasion of Ukraine.  The United States had recently exposed the Russian Federation's disinformation tactics and dispelled its attempts to malign peaceful United States' cooperation with Ukraine.  It had done so in the presence of delegations from 89 countries.  The United States and Ukraine offered an in-depth series of presentations that strongly refuted the Russian Federation's false claims of United States' biological weapons development and biolabs in Ukraine.  Technical experts from the United States and Ukrainian delegations unambiguously explained their cooperation and United States assistance related to public health facilities, biosafety, biosecurity and disease surveillance as part of the broader United States cooperative threat reduction.  The United States and Ukraine also highlighted how such activities were consistent with and further supported the provisions of the Biological Weapons Convention, particularly its article 10, which promoted cooperation and assistance by States parties.  He said that the use of chemical weapons in recent years in Iraq, Malaysia, Russian Federation, Syria and the United Kingdom, combined with the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the risk that revolutionary advances in life sciences might be misused for biological weapons underscored the need for effective international mechanisms for investigating the possible use of chemical, biological or toxin weapons.  The representative of the Russian Federation categorically rejected the continuing insinuations about its supposed involvement and use of nerve agents.  That was propaganda, the goal of which was to put continued economic and political pressure on the country.  London continued to refuse a substantive discussion and a joint investigation of what had occurred in Salisbury, resulting in the suffering of Russian citizens.  NATO Member States had used the media to communicate for several months and years.  London, Berlin and Stockholm had not provided any substantive responses to the Russian Federation's questions.  The Western States should clearly understand why NATO Member States were developing new forms of nerve agents.  He would continue to demand from the United Kingdom and Germany authorities comprehensive official information and ask them to fulfil their international legal obligations.  Finally, he drew attention to the fact that statements in support of OPCW and the Chemical Weapons Convention should not be based on selective approaches.  The representative of Syria refused allegations against his country.  The politicization of OPWC was used as a platform to realize some countries' narrow interests.  He condemned chemical weapons use anywhere, always and at any time.  Those countries claimed Syria had ignored the cooperation with OPCW, but Syria had fully cooperated with it since its accession to the Chemical Weapons Convention.  Syria had destroyed its chemical weapons stockpile, despite challenges, and continued to cooperate with the OPCW Technical Secretariat in a constructive manner.  Syria did not acknowledge the identification mechanism's legitimacy, as its formation was a hostile act against his country.  That was why the Western Powers were ignoring Syria's full cooperation, calling Syria non-compliant.  But, that politicized the situation and did not serve the Convention.  It was a bad example of how the Organization gave in to pressures.  He reminded those accusation-making countries that Syria was committed to non-proliferation and disarmament.  In 1968, Syria had acceded to the Geneva Protocol.  In 1969, to the NPT.  In 1972, to the Biological Weapons Convention, and in 2013, to the Chemical Weapons Convention.  The fact-finding missions did not respect the Convention's provisions.  While some countries continued to cast doubt on what Syria did, it had, in fact, done everything to work with the OPCW Technical Secretariat and respond positively to recommendations.  His delegation refused the inappropriate language of the United States that distorted Syria's image.  The United States was not in a position to make accusations against Syria.  The representative had no right to preach about international law or human rights, while his country engaged in hostile acts, flagrantly violated the Charter and international law, and attacked civilians.  It denied Syrian citizens the most basic rights by imposing unilateral coercive measures, stole barrels of oil and cotton, set fire to thousands of hectares of agricultural land, and denied food and medicine.  Through illegal coalitions, the United States committed thousands of crimes, killed hundreds of thousands, and destroyed hospitals, dams and care centres.  It protected Israel and refused to dispose of weapons, despite the set limits.  It had a proven track record of chemical and nuclear weapons use against the world's citizens, of which the results were still visible.  *For information media.

3897593,"*UNICEF survey finds half of households with children in the region are putting less food on their plates.*  **PANAMA CITY, 17 October 2022 '** Three years on, many families in Latin America and the Caribbean are still struggling to bounce back from the pandemic, according to a regional survey conducted by UNICEF. During the pandemic, half of households with children in Latin America and the Eastern Caribbean reduced food portion sizes for adults, and one in ten reduced portion sizes for children.   Families are not only eating smaller portions but also skipping meals. In the survey, 15 per cent of households with children reported eating less than three meals per day, up from 8 per cent in 2019, before the pandemic.   'The shock of the pandemic is far from over. Many parents are still struggling to recover the jobs they lost during the pandemic and can't afford to put enough food on their children's plates. The most vulnerable families haven't bounced back, putting children's health and wellbeing at risk,' said Youssouf Abdel-Jelil, UNICEF Regional Director a.i. for Latin America and the Caribbean.   According to the survey, just 60 per cent of adults in households with children are working, down from 67 per cent before the pandemic. For many the work is precarious: 37 per cent of households with children rely on informal income.   While the most vulnerable families' needs persist, the survey found that just 24 per cent of households with children currently receive some form of government support, down from 43 per cent in 2020. Food, employment, and medical attention are the main demands of families.   'Families in Latin America and the Caribbean have been hit several times, not just by the socioeconomic impact of COVID-19, but also by rising inflation due to the crisis in Ukraine. Without support, even more families will be pushed into poverty.  Children must be at the heart of national social protection policies, to help them and their families recover and thrive,' Abdel-Jelil added.   UNICEF calls on governments to continue investing in children and giving their families the support they need to reduce the lifelong effects of poverty.  **Media contacts**  **Sendai Zea**   Communication Specialist (Emergencies)   UNICEF Latin America and the Caribbean   Tel: +507 6821 0843   Email:",['Epidemic'],"['Food and Nutrition', 'Health', 'Recovery and Reconstruction']",['World'],News and Press Release
3897248,"**I. Introduction**  1\. The present report is submitted pursuant to Security Council resolution [2645 (2022)]( (2022)), by which the Council extended to 15 July 2023 the mandate of the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH), in accordance with Council resolution [2476 (2019)]( (2019)) establishing BINUH, and adjusted the reporting requirements from 120 days to 90 days. The report includes significant developments that have occurred since my previous report ([S/2022/481]( )) and provides an update on the implementation of the BINUH mandate.   **II. Political issues and good governance**  2\. The current situation in Haiti demonstrates the extent to which political, security, development and humanitarian dimensions are intertwined and mutually reinforcing. Armed gangs have thrived in this environment, increasing their strength and influence. In recent weeks, a dramatic deterioration in security has paralysed the country. Criminal gangs have taken control of vital strategic installations, such as the international port in Port-au-Prince and the country's main fuel terminal at Varreux. The blockage of the fuel terminal has brought critical services, such as water distribution and sanitation, garbage collection, electricity and health centres, to a virtual standstill. In this context, there has been an emergence of cholera, and the current situation has created the perfect conditions for an exponential increase in cholera across the country.  3\. Following the first anniversary of the assassination of the former President, Jovenel Moïse, on 7 July, civil unrest increased around Port-au-Prince, Cap-Haïtien (North Department), Petit-Goâve (West Department) and Jacmel (South-East Department), with major demonstrations protesting rising inflation and acute fuel shortages and calling for the resignation of the Prime Minister, Ariel Henry.  4\. The announcement by the Prime Minister on 11 September to remove fuel subsidies triggered a new phase of violent unrest. Roadblocks were set up throughout the country, leading to a full lockdown across the capital and large urban centres. Concerted action by the police to clear roads began on 16 September when an alliance of criminal gangs in the capital took control of the nation's main fuel terminal at Varreux. Signatories of the various agreements shifted alliances in the face of these growing tensions, adding a new layer of complexity to efforts towards consensus.  5\. During the unrest, the Prime Minister expressed empathy for the human suffering and deplored the looting of essential goods and humanitarian aid. He encouraged Haitians not to be misled by violent political rhetoric, to resist vested interests and to come together for the good of the nation. He reiterated his call for a broad and open dialogue with all stakeholders and emphasized the Government's commitment to strengthening the national police, increasing customs revenues, improving the economy and reducing regressive fuel subsidies.  6\. Referring to the socioeconomic grievances underlying the protests, the Prime Minister outlined a six-point social policy plan for the 2022/223 State budget, using additional allocations collected through customs and subsidy reform. The plan consists of: (a) investment in agricultural development and infrastructure; (b) school feeding; (iii) the building of soup kitchens; (d) a fund for creating decent jobs; (e) the cleaning up of the streets; and (f) fiscal interventions that will help to offset the rising cost of living.  7\. Many of the country's leading political figures spoke out during the civil unrest; most urged people to remain calm, while some encouraged demonstrators with overtly inflammatory language directed against the United Nations and diplomatic missions. The Minister of Justice and Public Security issued a statement condemning the violence and promising to hold instigators accountable before the law.  8\. Limited progress was made towards reaching a Haitian-led agreement that would enable legislative and presidential elections within a consensual time frame, despite efforts by BINUH to bring key actors to the table. Prior to the unrest, government representatives and several civil society groups and political platforms had worked on broadening consensus for elections and a return to constitutional order. At the end of June, the tripartite committee composed of representatives of academia, faith-based organizations and the private sector issued a report on consultations held with over 170 political parties and civil society organizations, on ending the crisis. The report proposed a new power-sharing arrangement based on a transition period of up to two years.  9\. On 14, 15 and 18 July, the Prime Minister, Ariel Henry, convened an opening round of negotiations between signatories of the 11 September political agreement and leaders of the joint delegation of the Commission for a Haitian Solution to the Crisis (known as the Montana Group) and the Protocole d'entente nationale. According to statements issued by both sides, disagreement remained as to whether the executive branch should continue to be led by a Prime Minister alone or be replaced by a temporary, dual-headed leadership consisting of both a President and a Prime Minister. There are also diverging views over including new, additional stakeholders in the talks.  10\. The political stalemate prompted a group of private sector actors to come forward in an open letter dated 23 August, asking the Government to mobilize domestic revenue through tax collection, duties and customs as a means of further financing the national police. The call was welcomed by many who expressed support for business leaders to play an influential role in containing the economic fallout from the crisis.  11\. There has been no movement on a nomination process to renew the ninemember Provisional Electoral Council, a necessary step for holding elections and a key provision of the 11 September political agreement. As a result, long-term capital investment in the institution and valuable human resources are being jeopardized.  12\. In addition to dialogue efforts made within the country, regional organizations have shown their willingness to take a proactive role in assisting the Government of Haiti. At its forty-third regular meeting, held from 3 to 5 July in Paramaribo, the Conference of Heads of Government of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) adopted a final communiqué expressing grave concern over the deteriorating security situation and confirming the region's willingness to assist in resolving the crisis, including through a fact-finding mission. Subsequently, the Government of Suriname hosted the fourth virtual meeting of the international partners of Haiti on 8 July with representatives of 17 Governments and international donors, where participants stressed the need for Haitian stakeholders to unite and chart a new way forward and urged contributions to the basket fund for security assistance to Haiti.  13\. At the request of the Government of Haiti, a special meeting of the Permanent Council of the Organization of American States (OAS) was convened on 17 August. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Worship of Haiti called upon regional partners to support efforts against arms trafficking. He requested assistance to bolster the national police and urgently provide law enforcement equipment. That request was reiterated on 1 September by the acting Director General of the Haitian National Police at the United Nations Chiefs of Police Summit held at United Nations Headquarters in New York.  14\. Subsequently, on 7 October, confronted with the continuing blocking of the port, which the police were unable to stop, and the emergence of cholera, the Government issued a request for the immediate deployment of an international specialized force in sufficient numbers to stop the humanitarian crisis across the country, largely caused by the actions of armed gangs, and to allow for the distribution of fuel and water, the functioning and opening of hospitals and schools and the free circulation of goods and people. On 8 October 2022, the Secretary-General submitted a letter addressed to the President of the Security Council ([S/2022/747]( )) on options for enhanced security support to Haiti, as requested by the Security Council in resolution [2645 (2022)]( (2022)), following broad consultations by the Secretariat, including a visit to Haiti from 4 to 7 September for discussions with the Government.   15\. Throughout this period, BINUH and the United Nations system continued to support renewed dialogue through informal consultations and meetings to identify constructive voices from marginalized communities, women and youth across the political spectrum. In cooperation with Haitian civil society, BINUH and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) held a governance workshop in June on key challenges related to security, constitutional reform and elections. On 13 August, the United Nations supported a forum with LGBTIQ+ groups, people with disabilities, people living with HIV/AIDS and women's organizations, which focused on the political inclusion of marginalized communities. BINUH supported a civil society gathering on 25 August renewing dialogue with members of the Government, the remaining third of the Senate, signatories of the 11 September political agreement and leaders of the joint Montana Group-Protocole d'entente nationale initiative. The Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs of the Secretariat also supported the deployment of two dialogue experts to explore options in the current political context.","['Earthquake', 'Epidemic']","['Education', 'Food and Nutrition', 'Health', 'Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding', 'Protection and Human Rights', 'Recovery and Reconstruction', 'Shelter and Non-Food Items']",['Haiti'],UN Document
1862689,"**As the Pacific braces itself for another cyclone season, UN Women is leading efforts to ensure that women and girls are at the centre of disaster preparedness, response and recovery work.**  Date: 17 January 2017  'We were at home on the night of the cyclone, the wind was too strong…it ripped our house apart and we ran. While we were hiding in another house, a tree fell and ripped the roof open...We ran again and found shelter in our neighbour's house,' recalls Salote Tubuna, a Fiji Rakiraki market vendor and farmer. Before the night was over, her neighbour's house was damaged by Tropical Cyclone Winston and the family took cover under a bed, waiting for daylight.  For the people in the Pacific, the cyclone season, which officially started in November 2016 and runs until April 2017, triggers painful memories. In the last season, three Category 4 cyclones devastated the Pacific simultaneously. Now is the time to ensure that the needs and voices of women and girls are integrated at all levels of planning on disaster preparedness, response and recovery.  'Promoting gender equality and the protection of women, girls, boys and men go hand in hand,' says Aleta Miller, UN Women's representative at the Fiji Multi-Country Office. 'It must be at the forefront of humanitarian planning and response, otherwise we are failing the people of the Pacific.""  UN Women's Fiji Multi-Country Office provides leadership to the Pacific Humanitarian Protection Cluster, a regional mechanism that works on enhancing regional and national capacity for gender and protection-sensitive disaster preparedness, response and recovery in Pacific Island Countries. By bringing together UN agencies, regional and international organizations with local authorities to identify and fulfill the needs of impacted communities, the Pacific Humanitarian Protection Cluster aims to integrate gender and protection concerns into humanitarian response.  For example, in August 2016, UN Women organized and delivered the Pacific Regional Gender and Protection in Humanitarian Action training in partnership with the Gender Standby Capacity Project, managed by the Norwegian Refugee Council. The training brought together government agencies, international and national organizations providing services and humanitarian assistance from Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands to discuss how women in all their diversity need to be part of all stages of emergency management. Since then, the participants have worked with UN Women to facilitate national trainings in their own countries, which have given further impetus for integrating gender and protection into all aspects of disaster planning and response mechanisms in their countries.  'Women are the first responders and a vital resource. You cannot do much without the wealth of knowledge that they have in the response, recovery and further development,' says Rothina Noka, the Gender and Protection Coordinator in the Vanuatu Government's Department of Women's Affairs. Rothina herself witnessed that when women were in leadership roles on Vanuatu's community disaster committees and part of decision-making, the needs of women, children and people with disabilities were more likely to be considered and met.  'We especially need to build the capacity of women so that when disaster strikes women can easily respond; they can be ready,' adds Solomon Islands' Under Secretary for Ministry of Women, Youth, Children and Family Affairs, Hugo Hebala.  The initiative has vital implications in the Pacific, where persisting gender inequalities often lead to additional vulnerabilities and different impacts for women and girls when disasters strike. The same inequalities can also shut out women's voices from decision-making processes that shape disaster preparedness, response and rebuilding efforts, and in some cases even restrict their mobility. For example, in the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Pam, which devastated Vanuatu in March 2015, some women were discouraged from going to the evacuation centres by men, and widows and people with disabilities were forgotten in the distribution of food.  The Pacific Humanitarian Protection Cluster is taking steps towards ensuring that integrating gender and protection needs is the norm, rather than an option or afterthought.","['Flood', 'Storm Surge', 'Tropical Cyclone']",['Disaster Management'],"['Fiji', 'Samoa', 'Solomon Islands', 'Tonga', 'Vanuatu', 'World']",News and Press Release
3694731,"MANILA, December 7, 2020 ' Thousands of families remain internally displaced temporarily staying in designated evacuation centers and makeshift shelters after Super Typhoon Rolly (international name Goni) battered the Bicol region, followed by Typhoon Ulysses (international name Vamco) which caused further devastation and massive flooding to the rest of Luzon including Rizal, Cagayan, Isabela, Metro Manila, and neighboring provinces. Rolly, considered the strongest typhoon to hit the country this year, destroyed more than 100,000 houses while Ulysses brought heavy rains causing dams to release water, submerging many low-lying areas in Cagayan and Isabela.  One month after the twin typhoons, child-focused non-profit agency World Vision in coordination with the local government units and other humanitarian agencies have initially assisted over 27,000 affected people wherein nearly half of these are children in the Albay, Catanduanes, Rizal, Cagayan and Isabela.  'The needs of the families affected by two strong typhoons and the massive flooding in just a month are still significant. As most of the displaced families transition from evacuation centers to makeshift shelters, challenges still remain such as protection issues and lack of access to basic needs,"" shares World Vision National Director in the Philippines, Rommel Fuerte.  As of December 04, 2020, a total of 6,427 affected families or 27,400 individuals received support in the form of hygiene kits, shelter kits, household non-food items, food packs, and maternity kits. World Vision targets to complete its reach of 10,000 families in the next two months.  World Vision also implements its extensive relief operations in Catanduanes and Albay with the help of United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the Melissa & Bill Gates Foundation and the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO)- funded consortium project with OXFAM, ADRA, and PDRN. To widen the reach of the response, World Vision also tapped local partner community-based organizations, Pangkaunlaran Development Association Inc., United Methodist Metro Santiago District and Green Meadow Development Foundation (GMDF), to help the flood-affected families in Northern Luzon.  As the response transitions from relief to recovery phase, World Vision is focused on providing support in shelter and livelihood sectors with emphasis on cash-based programming modalities. These include provision of shelter repair kits that include repair materials and carpentry tools and cash assistance for shelter repair.  As a child-focused organization, World Vision is concerned with the welfare of children especially those living in makeshift shelter where need for decent and livable space, protection and hygiene and sanitation in the midst of ongoing pandemic and continuing threat of natural hazard such as typhoon and heavy rains. In the education sector, Department of Education (DepEd) reported about 400,000 learning materials were damaged, adding difficulty for children to adapt and cope with the new normal learning approach.  'We want the affected families and children to feel the essence of generosity and oneness especially that Christmas season is already here,' says Fuerte. 'We thank our donors and sponsors who supported our efforts. Let us continue to pray and support for the recovery of the families.'","['Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Tropical Cyclone']","['Education', 'Protection and Human Rights', 'Shelter and Non-Food Items', 'Water Sanitation Hygiene']",['Philippines'],News and Press Release
3695011,"**The disaster response group, AKUT, pulled survivors from the rubble of last month's Aegean quake. Now, they're providing ongoing support to Turkey's displaced.**  By Talya Meyers  On October 30, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake originating in the Aegean Sea ripped through the province of Izmir, in Turkey, causing widespread damage to the country's third-largest city.  Immediately following the earthquake, a tsunami damaged parts of the coastline. At least 116 people were killed, and over 1,000 injured. According to the Turkish disaster response group, AKUT, more than 4,000 families have lost their homes.  More than 80 camps were established to house those displaced.  New aftershocks regularly shake the area, with more than 1,400 recorded thus far, AKUT reported. 'Every day we have at least magnitude 3 earthquakes,' said Gülçin Güreşçi, the group's CEO.  And although some have found alternate housing or have been accommodated in local hotels, hundreds are still living in campsites facing ongoing displacement as winter falls on Turkey.  In the aftermath of the quake, AKUT's volunteers dug through the rubble, rescuing nine people along with several cats and dogs ' and a rabbit, Güreşçi said.  It's no surprise. Originally founded by a small group of self-sufficient mountain climbers, AKUT, a Turkish search-and-rescue and aid organization, has grown to approximately 3,000 volunteers accustomed to disaster response ' and to providing ongoing and when the event is over.  After participating in the rescue effort, AKUT's next priority is to distribute much-needed supplies to people displaced by the quake.  **To support AKUT in its ongoing response to the earthquake, Direct Relief is providing the organization with a $50,000 emergency grant, along with a donation of emergency medical backpacks designed to address a wide range of health issues in the field.**  Güreşçi's biggest concern is those still living in camps, in close quarters amid the pandemic. To complicate matters, Turkey's cold winter has begun.  The group's support will focus on children, those with disabilities or at high risk of Covid complications, vulnerable women-led households, and Turkey's large refugee population.  The country currently hosts approximately 3.6 million Syrian refugees, along with hundreds of thousands from other nationalities. (The Brookings Institute said that Turkey hosts more refugees than any other country in the world.) According to AKUT, refugees are more likely to be afraid to ask for government or other support, due to their uncertain status.  AKUT is working to distribute bags containing emergency supplies such as blankets and headlamps, along with masks, hand sanitizer, and first aid kit materials to those still displaced by the quake. With Direct Relief's grant, the group anticipates that it will be able to reach approximately 2,000 people with support.  In addition, the group is working to promote awareness of Covid-19 in the camps and to educate those staying there about safe practices such as handwashing and social distancing.  Covid-19 and associated lockdowns have made it more complicated for AKUT to distribute aid, Güreşçi said. Although the organization has about 300 volunteers on the ground, they must move through the camps escorted and in small groups.  Officials running the camps 'want to see that we are protected from Covid and don't have Covid to spread,' she explained.  But Güreşçi said that the government has been responsive in providing housing, medical aid, and other support, and that community response has been strong as well.

3897372,"*'We must not wait for famine to be declared to act'*  Trócaire today warned of a rapid deterioration in the food crisis in drought-ravaged Somalia, saying the international community must not wait for famine to be declared to adequately respond.  Trócaire Country Director Manager for Somalia, Paul Healy, said the situation is the worst in living memory, with the number of people experiencing acute hunger already surpassing the number affected in the famine of 2011, when more than a quarter of a million people died. One in six people in the East African country are now facing extreme hunger.  The crisis is being replicated across the Horn and East Africa, including Ethiopia and South Sudan where Trócaire also operates, with one person now thought to be dying in the region every 36 seconds.  'Somalia is on the fast track towards famine, but we should not have to wait until famine is officially declared for a proper response. The international community needs to act and act now. What we are seeing on the ground is devastating. People are suffering. Children are dying.' said Mr Healy.   Mr Healy was speaking after the broadcast of a harrowing report on BBC One TV from a Trócaire hospital in Dollow, Gedo region, southern Somalia, where the aid agency provides critical health and nutrition support to over 200,000 people. The report captured the death from hunger of a two-year-old boy at the Dollow Health Referral Centre, and his subsequent burial afterwards by his family.  'This was heart-breaking to witness. But this is the reality our team on the ground and the communities are facing daily. Hunger is claiming lives at an ever-increasing rate. The alarm has been sounding for months but the international community and governments have not adequately responded. How many more people need to die before the world acts?'  He said climate change has wiped out crops and three million livestock have died in Somalia since mid-2021, with large parts of the country about to enter what is projected to be its fifth failed rainy season. A failed rainfall season in late 2022 would leave no prospects for recovery until at least the start of the next rainfall season in April 2023.  Mr Healy said a million people have been displaced in Somalia this year, 800,000 due to drought. 'The crisis has been exacerbated in many places by conflict, and by rising food prices due in part to the war in Ukraine, and reduced supply from neighbouring countries also struggling. This has resulted in sorghum, maize and wheat prices reaching near‑record to record levels in July, beyond the reach of most poor households who depend heavily on market purchases to access food.'  Mr Healy added that women are particularly hard hit by the crisis, reducing their own food to feed their children. Across the Horn of Africa region, increasing numbers of girls are in danger of leaving school as the crisis deepens, putting them at higher risk of child marriage and FGM. The number of children at risk of dropping out of school in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia due to the impact of the drought has tripled in the space of three months ' from 1.1. million to an estimated 3.3 million children.  Mr Healy said alarming levels of mortality and malnutrition are already occurring. 'We have seen the number of malnourished children coming to our health centres in Gedo for treatment triple in recent months. 'We are barely able to cope with the numbers in Gedo.

Elizabeth Crafford.      **Sabancaya** (Peru) *Daily explosions, ash emissions, and thermal anomalies from dome during April-September 2021*  *Please cite this report as:*      Global Volcanism Program, 2021. Report on Sabancaya (Peru) (Crafford, A.E., and Venzke, E., eds.). *Bulletin of the Global Volcanism Network,* 46:10. Smithsonian Institution.  **Sabancaya**  **Peru**  **15.787°S, 71.857°W; summit elev. 5960 m**  **All times are local (unless otherwise noted)**  Although tephrochronology has dated activity at Sabancaya back several thousand years, renewed activity that began in 1986 was the first recorded since 1784. A new period of explosive activity that began in November 2016 has been characterized by pulses of ash emissions with some plumes exceeding 10 km altitude, frequent thermal anomalies, and significant SO2 plumes. Daily ash emissions and high levels of SO2 continued during April-September 2021, the period covered in this report. The Observatorio Vulcanologico INGEMMET (OVI) reported daily on numbers of explosions, ash plume heights and directions of drift, seismicity, ashfall, and other activity; IGP (Instituto Geophysico del Peru) issued weekly reports of activity.  Activity at Sabancaya during April-September 2021 consisted of tens of daily explosions with dense gas-and-ash plumes, strong SO2 emissions, and persistent thermal anomalies from the growing dome at the summit crater. Ash plumes rose 1-2 km above the summit on most days; higher plumes occasionally reached 2.5-3.0 km. Ash most commonly drifted E and SE but there was significant variation in the wind direction. Ashfall was reported in communities around the volcano on multiple days each month except September. The Buenos Aires Volcanic Ash Advisory Center (VAAC) issued three or four daily reports of ongoing ash emissions throughout the period. The plumes rose to 6.4-8.2 km altitude and drifted in various directions, often visible in satellite imagery. Minor inflation was reported on the N flank near Hualca Hualca throughout the period.  Moderate levels of thermal energy were reported by the MIROVA project during April-September 2021 with minor fluctuations throughout the period (figure 103). The MODVOLC system reported seven thermal alerts in April, two in May, three in June, eleven in July, six in August, and two in September. Thermal anomalies and ash emissions were visible in Sentinel-2 satellite images multiple times each month (figure 104). Moderate to strong SO2 emissions were recorded virtually every day during the period by the TROPOMI instrument on the Sentinel-5P satellite (figure 105).  Thermal anomalies were present inside the summit crater on 9, 19, 24, and 29 April 2021. Dense ash plumes rose 800-2,800 m above the crater rim from the 37-87 daily explosions. Intermittent ash plumes were reported daily by the Buenos Aires VAAC at 7.0-8.2 km altitude, drifting in multiple directions. Strong winds produced an ash plume that was visible in satellite imagery 100 km SE on 24 April (figure 106). Ashfall was reported on 12 days in different communities. Huanca reported ashfall on 6, 12, and 13 April, and it was noted in Madrigal and Pinchollo on 15, 17, 19, and 21 April. During 16-19 April ash was reported in Cabanaconde; it fell in Achoma Maca on 19 and 21 April, in Huambo on 20 April, and in Anexo de Salla on 25-26 April.  Ash emissions from 43-75 daily explosions continued throughout May 2021 rising as high as 3.2 km above the summit, with ashfall reported in Madrigal and Pinchollo on 1 May and in Cabanaconde the next day. Huanca reported ashfall on 10 May, and Chivay, Achoma, Maca, and Madrigal reported it on 16 May. The next day ash fell in Chivay, Ichupampa, and Coporaque. Small amounts of ash were reported in Los Anexos de Pillones and Vincocaya in the district of San Antonio de Chuca on 19 and 20 May. Achoma and Yanque reported ashfall on 22 May. Ash plumes rose from multiple different areas of the summit crater on several occasions (figure 107). The Buenos Aires VAAC reported that daily ash emissions rose to 6.4-8.2 km altitude and drifted mostly E or SE. Thermal anomalies were present in satellite images on 4, 9, 14, 19, and 29 May.  Sentinel-2 satellite images showed thermal anomalies inside the summit crater on 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, and 28 June 2021. All were accompanied by ash emissions. Dense ash plumes rose up to 2,400 m above the summit from many of the 51-80 daily explosions (figure 108). The Buenos Aires VAAC also reported multiple plumes each day rising to 6.4-8.2 km altitude and drifting NE, E, or SE. Ashfall was reported in Achoma, Yanque, and Chivay during 2-4 June, and in Coporaque and Ichupampa on 3 June. Small amounts of ash were reported on 14 June in Chivay, Yanque, Ichupampa, and Coporaque, and on 30 June in Yanque, Achoma, Coporaque, Madrigal, and Cabanaconde.  Ashfall was reported in Cabanaconde on 1 July, in Huanca on 11, 22, and 23 July, and in Achoma on 16-17 July. Thermal anomalies, some with multiple distinct hotspots, were recorded in satellite images on 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, and 28 July. Plume heights ranged from 1,100-2,500 m above the summit from 47-118 daily explosions from several sites within the crater (figure 109); the Buenos Aires VAAC reported ash emissions drifting in many directions at 6.1-7.6 km altitude each day during the month.  The average number of daily explosions during August 2021 varied each week between 36 and 54, with plumes reported 2-3.5 km above the summit (figure 110). During the week of 9-15 August ash emissions were visible in satellite images drifting 134 km E and NE. The next week they appeared 68 km from the summit, and small amounts of ashfall were reported in Madrigal and Pinchollo. Satellite images showed thermal anomalies at the summit on 2, 12, 17, and 22 August. The Buenos Aires VAAC reported daily ash emissions rising to 6.7-8.2 km altitude. Similar activity continued throughout September 2021; ashfall was reported in Madrigal on 4 September. The number of daily explosions averaged 26-44 each week and plumes were reported 2-4 km above the summit. The Buenos Aires VAAC reported the daily ash emissions rising to 7.0-8.2 km altitude and drifting in multiple different directions. Satellite images showed thermal anomalies at the summit on 1, 11, and 16 September.  ***Geological Summary.*** Sabancaya, located in the saddle NE of Ampato and SE of Hualca Hualca volcanoes, is the youngest of these volcanic centers and the only one to have erupted in historical time. The oldest of the three, Nevado Hualca Hualca, is of probable late-Pliocene to early Pleistocene age. The name Sabancaya (meaning ""tongue of fire"" in the Quechua language) first appeared in records in 1595 CE, suggesting activity prior to that date. Holocene activity has consisted of Plinian eruptions followed by emission of voluminous andesitic and dacitic lava flows, which form an extensive apron around the volcano on all sides but the south. Records of historical eruptions date back to 1750.  ***Information Contacts:*** *Observatorio Volcanologico del INGEMMET* (Instituto Geológical Minero y Metalúrgico), Barrio Magisterial Nro. 2 B-16 Umacollo - Yanahuara Arequipa, Peru (URL:  ); *Sentinel Hub Playground* (URL:  ); *NASA Global Sulfur Dioxide Monitoring Page,* Atmospheric Chemistry and Dynamics Laboratory, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA/GSFC), 8800 Greenbelt Road, Goddard MD, USA (URL:  ); *MIROVA* (Middle InfraRed Observation of Volcanic Activity), a collaborative project between the Universities of Turin and Florence (Italy) supported by the Centre for Volcanic Risk of the Italian Civil Protection Department (URL:  ); *Hawai'i Institute of Geophysics and Planetology* (HIGP) - MODVOLC Thermal Alerts System, School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST), Univ. of Hawai'i, 2525 Correa Road, Honolulu, HI 96822, USA (URL:  ).",['Volcano'],,['Peru'],News and Press Release

1638611,"Local people in Mandalay place the blame on land work projects for the floods which have inundated some areas this year.  The land work has changed the water way, causing it to overflow from the creeks and the Ayeyawady River. 'The situation of this year's flood, which submerged some areas with unusual strength, is considered to be because of man-made works, and La Nina has also made the situation worsen,' said Chief Minister of Mandalay Region Dr Zaw Myint Maung.  As the water level of the Ayeyawady River is rising around Pyay, Shwetaung and Padaung townships the Bago Region Government has opened 24 shelters for people in low-lying areas.  'Currently, the water level has reached six inches above the danger level but it may reach about two feet above the danger level over the next two days. People in low-lying areas are advised to move to the safe shelters,' said  Director General of the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology Har Yin Naing Ti Yan.","['Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Severe Local Storm']",['Shelter and Non-Food Items'],['Myanmar'],News and Press Release
3892532,"KwaZulu-Natal Premier, Nomusa Dube-Ncube, says government has put in place a practical plan to move those affected by the floods out of community care centres by the end of November 2022.   Giving a progress report on interventions and recovery since the April/May flood disaster in the province, Dube-Ncube announced that the number of community care centres has been reduced from 135 to 80.  'As was announced, the national Department of Human Settlements has since granted a total amount of R325 764 000 to the provincial department, from the Provincial Emergency Housing Grant, for the provision of emergency housing solutions.  'This has enabled the delivery of Temporary Residential Units (TRUs), which currently stand at 1 315 units provincially. Out of the 1 315 TRUs complete to date, 1 202 have been occupied, leaving 113 unoccupied,' Dube-Ncube.  **Eighty shelters linked to land parcels**  The Premier said while all the remaining 80 shelters have now been linked to land parcels, the land parcels are at different stages of readiness.  'We appreciate the approval of the Rental Assistance Scheme and Temporary Residential Accommodation, which will help us achieve the eradication of all mass care centres,' Dube-Ncube said.  She said the plan to get people out of community care centres going forward will include eight land parcels, which include cotton lands that are at site clearance stage with 1 064 TRUs; and the acquisition of La Mercy land, which is now at an advanced stage, with all the necessary approvals being secured and sale agreements being circulated.  A specialised technical team has been established to focus on the programme of getting people out of community care centres and all mop up operations.  **Families moved from Truro Hall to dignified accommodation**  Dube-Ncube said 47 families living at Truro Hall Community Care Centre will be moved to a dignified transitional accommodation, where each family will have a room of their own.  'The 50-room building will, from this week, become a new home for the families who lived in Truro Hall. Today's closure of the Truro Hall Community Care Centre represents the progress we are making as government to help people rebuild their lives,' Dube-Ncube said.   The facility, which is a former student housing complex, has 50 lockable rooms, with two or three beds each; CCTV cameras, hot water, a perimeter fence, security gate, and biometrics.  The complex also has a kitchen with four four-plate stoves, a lounge, kids' homework area, ensuite and common bathrooms, and a guardhouse.  The Premier said the Department of Social Development will issue vouchers to the families during the course of the week to assist in procuring food items.  'As we relocate these families here, earthworks and construction is underway... where the Department of Human Settlement and Public Works is building 80 new state-of-the-art three-story buildings that will become permanent homes for our citizens whose lives and livelihoods were devastated by the floods,' the Premier said.

3694561,"**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**  YAPPIKA-ActionAid Indonesia launched the emergency response and recovery (ERR) programme in three districts of Central Sulawesi from October 2018 to September 2020. This response was implemented to address the impact of the earthquake and tsunami that struck the area, and caused destruction to the environment, resulting in more than 100 000 people losing their homes and the loss of more than 4 000 lives. The programme aimed at helping the most vulnerable groups affected by the disaster, namely women and children, to regain their footing and well-being and have access to protection mechanisms in the face of the dire situation the tsunami created. The project also involved women taking up leadership roles as focal points in their respective communities, to address the humanitarian crisis and facilitate the restarting of their livelihood activities to support their household and community economy.   The evaluation aims at providing inputs for the improvement of humanitarian actions by ActionAid and other humanitarian agencies. It also provides an analysis on adherence to accountability measures in humanitarian responses, and the assurance that women and other vulnerable groups affected by this disaster have been adequately supported by the programme.   The Core Humanitarian Standards (CHS) are used as a basic framework for the evaluation with reference to several other standards, such as ActionAid's (AA) Accountability Framework and the Women-Led Community-Based Protection (WLCBP) concept. The evaluation used a combination of participatory approaches for data collection and analysis which included, amongst others, appreciative enquiries, participatory reflection and review processes, Focus Group Discussions (FGD), Key Informant Interviews and various tools for gender analysis and rural appraisal such as village mapping, Venn diagram, Harvard Gender Analysis Matrix, etc.   The analysis shows that overall, the programme has achieved almost all its objectives as outlined in the programme design and theory of change. The programme also demonstrates compliance with almost all CHS criteria but needs more work in the areas of coordination and collaboration among the partner organizations, accountability to affected populations and achieving a full participation of the community in decision-making processes.   One of the most notable achievements is the emergence of many women leaders among the communities. The programme, facilitated by the partner organisations, was able to successfully build the capacity of local women to become more confident and self-reliant, by providing spaces where they can express their concerns and opinions freely. Capacity building and strengthening the local capacity and community resilience are clearly the areas where this programme excels; cost efficiency and capacity to deliver results with the optimal use of resources is also another winning point for the programme. While the financial benefits were comparatively insignificant, for example the income from livelihood activities, the programme has clearly invested in the future by using the resources to develop local institutions, knowledge transfer and experiences and hone the skills of local partners and communities, particularly women, to address humanitarian crises and creating opportunities for women's leadership in this area.   The programme findings that could be identified as lessons learned are as follows:  1) The requirement to follow the CHS and AA humanitarian standards such as the Accountability Framework, AA's Humanitarian Signature and WLCBP should be accompanied with proper guidance on how to understand and put them into operation. Partners did follow YAA's guidance but were yet to understand fully how it is interpreted in the design and implementation;  2) The initial assessment was sufficient to make informed decisions for the programme design, particularly in the first phase. In the second phase, however, a more in-depth needs assessment should be carried out to better address the needs of the community, instead of responding to a 'wish list' such as in implementing livelihood activities where only a few of the beneficiaries could participate meaningfully;  3)  Working with women focused organizations is a strategic choice of partnership. It is important, however, to provide clear guidance, regular monitoring and mentoring on how to measure their performance to ensure that it is in line with YAA's agenda on women-led protection programmes humanitarian contexts;  4)  The scale of the programme and type of intervention was quite challenging for implementing partners. Proper support to improve their capacity in planning, operations and financial management should be an integral part of the capacity building intervention from YAA;  5)  Different focus, agenda and characteristics of partners affect the level of coordination and cooperation between implementing partners. While each achieved the targeted outputs, there was no connection or complementary agenda amongst them. Inter-partner cross learning and support should be encouraged and promoted;   6)  Livelihood activities, albeit small in scale and limited to the production of certain commodities only, are a good entry point at the community level and have a lot of potential to be scaled up for sustainability;  7)  Advocacy work should be inherent to the activities on the ground, as many initiatives could be promoted with sufficient support from relevant government agencies, be it in the form of legalizing land titles by village authorities, or providing links to external resources for scaling up production and access to markets, or improving product quality and business management capacity;   8)  While the programme has encouraged partners to facilitate community-based disaster risk mapping, there is little understanding on how to assess the environmental impact of disasters or whether a mitigation plan is in place; and  9)  It is unfortunate that the programme, despite YAA's expertise and experience in advocacy work, has not yet addressed the pertinent issues relevant to disaster risk reduction and humanitarian action in the region; partners only launched sporadic advocacy work without significant results related to the rights of survivors. Interestingly, at the village level, several women, who engaged in the programme have successfully advocated for these issues and influenced government decisions ' such as in obtaining a living allowance as well as a stimulant fund for housing. This needs to be documented and promoted for possible replication in other areas.   Recommendations for the improvement of the humanitarian actions:  1.  Set up a proper management structure for the ERR team: A defined management structure through partnerships or direct implementation would increase its effectiveness in managing humanitarian actions;  2.  Have YAA lead on coordination: For the coordination to be effective and strategic, YAA, based on its strengths and extensive experience, should take a leadership role in coordination from an early stage;  3.  Focus on organizational strengths and comparative advantages to increase visibility and significant impact: The promotion of WLCBP and AA's Accountability Framework in humanitarian action would be more beneficial in the long run rather than investing in physical construction where AA probably has limited experience and expertise;   4.  Invest more in capacity building: Ensure that sufficient resources are being invested to map the available local institutions and human resources, with a clear mechanism and faculty for capacity building. This is particularly relevant to areas that are key to YAA/AAI such as in WLCBP, various humanitarian standards and frameworks, organizational management, including the capacity to evaluate environmental impacts. This applies to both partners and internal organizations;   5.  Use screening tools to select partners: No matter how small the window of opportunity is to conduct a stakeholder analysis, it is imperative to choose partners that are strategic to implementation based on a proper assessment. The use of YAA tools such as OCPAT would be useful to assess the capacity of local civil society organizations to engage in humanitarian action;   6.  Set exit and sustainability strategies: Despite the short period of engagement, it is necessary to integrate an exit strategy into each programme's design so as to ensure that there is a proper handover in place, and to sustainability map out interventions that have potential to develop post-ERR;   7.  Proactively seek engagement with the government early on: It is important to engage early with the government, not only to increase visibility, but also to pave the way for future work should there be themes that need to be scaled up, promoted or supported by the government, and also to ensure a smooth handover of the programme by the end of the intervention. Such a relationship is also useful in case the programme and/or partners have an advocacy agenda related to survivors' rights and empowerment in the aftermath of a disaster;   8.  Document and study ERR programme experience: It is important to continue learning from experiences, to continually improve humanitarian action considering that disasters could happen anywhere in different forms, scales, and circumstances. To enrich YAA's repository, documentation and inventory of best practices, lessons learned, and successful models of women-led disaster management programmes where ActionAid has engaged would be valuable input for the organization in developing effective engagement strategies;  9.  Ensure all internal systems for programme support and management are well understood by all parties involved: It is important that all staff and partners involved understand what to expect from the project's performance. The MOU should clearly spell out the rights and obligations of the partnership, including accountability measures, M&E system, grievance mechanisms, transparency and all the dos and don'ts to avoid mishaps or misinterpretation along the way.   10.  Set up a support system available to staff involved in the humanitarian response: Emergency situations are extremely stressful and hard on staff. It is important that proper services are also available to address staff well-being and avoid occupational hazards. Psychosocial services, R&R and other incentives to create a work-life balance should be integrated in SOPs and HR policies;  11.  Build local CSOs organizational strength for follow up advocacy programmes: YAA in Indonesia is recognized as an advocate to promote inclusive education and often leads in advocating socio-economic and citizens' rights, both at the sub-national and particularly at the national levels. It would be strategic to use this experience and expertise to support local advocacy groups in their identifying issues that need to be tackled post-disaster. Further discussion with local CSOs as well as coordination with the local government could be the next step that YAA takes in the future.","['Earthquake', 'Tsunami']","['Protection and Human Rights', 'Recovery and Reconstruction']",['Indonesia'],Evaluation and Lessons Learned
3683268,"##Highlights  ' Between July and September 2020, 30,543 refugees and migrants (25% children) arrived in Europe. With the COVID-19 pandemic, all countries, except Italy, reported a decrease in arrivals, compared to the same period in 2019.  ' In Greece, Italy, Bulgaria, Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, 7,900 children accessed child protection services including mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS), case management and referral, while over 1,800 attended formal and nonformal education activities. Around 1,400 women, girls, boys, and men benefitted from gender-based violence (GBV) prevention and response.  ' On 9 September, a fire at the Moria Reception and Identification Centre (RIC) left 12,000 refugees and migrants, including 4,200 children, homeless. Within 24 hours, all 406 previously identified unaccompanied and separated children were safely transferred to the mainland. The Government of Greece, supported by UNICEF and partners, has been leading efforts to ensure the provision of clean water, hygiene, shelter, protection and education.  ' UNICEF welcomes the relocation to date of 1,000 asylum seekers (mostly unaccompanied and separated children) from Greece to other EU member states in 2020 and encourages further relocations.  ' The COVID pandemic continues to acutely impact the health and wellbeing of the refugee and migrant populations, who suffer from limited access to basic services such as psychosocial support, education, healthcare and legal aid. There remains continued need to assure support for children, who represent almost a quarter of all refugee and migrant population, and who continue to be exposed to separation from their families/caregivers, psychological distress and sexual abuse and violence.  ##Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs  With the easing of COVID-related movement restrictions, the number of refugee and migrant arrivals in Europe increased significantly during the reporting period. New arrivals between July and September are estimated at 30,543, bringing the total number of arrivals in 2020 to 58,8501 . With almost a quarter of these new arrivals being children, the estimated number of children present in Greece, Italy, Bulgaria, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro is now 73,000, many of whom remain dependent on continued humanitarian assistance, including 10,740 UASC.   The main countries of origin are Tunisia (20,6%), Algeria (14%), Bangladesh (7%), Afghanistan (6.5%)2 , Syria (6,3%) and Morocco (6,1%).   The map shows the active, extremely hazardous sea migration routes used by refugees and migrants to enter Europe.   The COVID pandemic continues to acutely impact the health and wellbeing of the refugee and migrant populations, who are disproportionately vulnerable to the fluid public health context, with limited access to basic services such as psychosocial support, education and healthcare.   There remains continued need to assure support for children, who represent almost quarter of all refugee and migrant population, and who continue to be exposed to separation from their families/caregivers, psychological distress and sexual abuse and violence.   In early September, fires broke out at the Moria Reception & Identification Centre (RIC) located on the Greek island of Lesvos. The centre, home to approximately 12,000 refugees, migrants and asylum seekers , 4,200 of whom children including over 400 unaccompanied and separated children, was severely damaged, forcing people to flee for safety.   The refugee and migrant centre in Moria had long been a concern due to the overcrowding, unhygienic conditions, and lack of services, as it continued to operate with a population many times its designed maximum capacity of 2,757 people.","['Epidemic', 'Fire']","['Contributions', 'Coordination', 'Education', 'Food and Nutrition', 'Health', 'Protection and Human Rights', 'Shelter and Non-Food Items', 'Water Sanitation Hygiene']","['Afghanistan', 'Algeria', 'Bangladesh', 'Bosnia and Herzegovina', 'Bulgaria', 'Greece', 'Iraq', 'Italy', 'Montenegro', 'Morocco', 'Pakistan', 'Serbia', 'Spain', 'Syrian Arab Republic', 'Tunisia', 'Türkiye', 'World']",Situation Report

3903051,"**Short summary**  Limiting global warming to 1.5°C could save glaciers in two-thirds of World Heritage sites  Glaciers are crucial sources of life on Earth as they provide vital water resources to half of humanity for domestic use, agriculture and hydropower. They are also sacred places for many local communities and attract millions of tourists globally.   Glaciers are some of the most valuable indicators for understanding climate change.   Among the most dramatic evidence that Earth's climate is warming is the retreat and disappearance of glaciers around the world. Closely observing and quantifying this phenomenon is essential to develop effective adaptation responses.   Around 18,600 glaciers have been identified in 50 World Heritage sites. These glaciers span an area of about 66,000 km², representing almost 10% of the Earth's glacierized area.   Research studies performed with satellite data highlight that these glaciers have been retreating at an accelerating rate since 2000. World Heritage glaciers lose on average some 58 billion tonnes of ice every year —equivalent to the total annual volume of water consumed in France and Spain together—and contribute to almost 5% of global observed sea-level rise. Projections indicate that glaciers in one-third of World Heritage glacierized sites will disappear by 2050 regardless of the applied climate scenario and glaciers in around half of all sites could almost entirely disappear by 2100 in a business-as-usual emissions scenario.   The most important protective measure to counteract substantial glacier retreat worldwide is to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. If emissions are drastically cut to limit global warming to 1.5°C relative to pre-industrial levels, glaciers in two-thirds of World Heritage sites could be saved. At site level, adaptative measures need to be strengthened to respond to inevitable glacier changes in the near future. These include identifying knowledge gaps and improving monitoring networks, designing and implementing early warning and disaster risk reduction measures, making glaciers a focus of targeted policy, and promoting knowledge exchange, stakeholder engagement and communication.   The successful implementation of these measures requires the mobilization of key stakeholders (e.g., governments, civil society, Indigenous Peoples, local communities and the private sector) to develop sustainable financing and investments, notably through the establishment of an international fund for glacier research and monitoring.","['Drought', 'Flood', 'Heat Wave']","['Climate Change and Environment', 'Disaster Management']",['World'],Analysis

Worsening socio-economic conditions of some populations are increasing the region's vulnerability. Demographic changes, urbanization, and environmental degradation have reduced the amount of habitable land available, forcing the settlement of hazard-prone, marginal lands, such as flood plains and steep slopes. In addition to natural disasters, civil crises and complex emergencies also cause hardships and impede development. USAID/OFDA is committed to assisting in the development of preparedness, mitigation, and emergency response capacities in the region.

PEER is geared primarily towards earthquake preparedness, but is widely applicable to any collapsed structure or mass casualty situation. PEER assists local, regional, and national disaster management agencies in organizing and conducting training in medical first response, collapsed structure search and rescue, and hospital preparedness for mass casualties. The first phase of PEER, managed by the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (ADPC), began in 1998 in India, Indonesia, Nepal, and the Philippines. Phase II of PEER expanded activities to Bangladesh and Pakistan, as well as increasing the corps of trainers, adapting courses to national requirements, and creating a network of disaster responders in each country. Beginning in April 2009, Phase III of the program will focus on improving communitylevel preparedness in collapsed structure search and rescue, medical first response, and disaster planning and preparedness. USAID/OFDA has provided more than $11 million since FY 1998. <p>- Program for Hydrometeorological Risk Mitigation in Asian Cities (PROMISE): In September 2005, USAID/OFDA provided a grant to ADPC for a three-year phase of urban disaster mitigation activities entitled &quot;PROMISE.&quot; This program builds upon the activities of the Asian Urban Disaster Mitigation Program (AUDMP) in which ADPC developed pilot disaster preparedness projects in targeted Asian cities. PROMISE promotes hydrometeorological, or rainfall-related, disaster preparedness through demonstration projects in five rapidly growing urban areas that have been significantly impacted by hydrometeorological disasters: Chittagong, Bangladesh; Hyderabad, Pakistan; Dagupan City, the Philippines; Kalutara, Sri Lanka; and Da Nang, Vietnam. In FY 2007, PROMISE was expanded to include the city of Semarang in Indonesia. In the target cities, ADPC has facilitated preparedness and mitigation action planning workshops, carried out hazard mapping and vulnerability assessments, and established community-based early warning mechanisms.

The Volcanic Alert Level remains at Level 2.**  The Gaua volcano activity has now increased in the high level of the major unrest state, consistent with the Volcanic Alert Level 2. New analyses suggest that this volcano activity is likely to continue at this same level of major unrest (Level 2) or increase to the minor eruption state (Level 3). Volcanic hazards remain on the Gaua volcanic cone (e.g. volcanic gases). The danger zone for life safety is limited on the **volcanic cone.**  Ground observations and satellite data confirmed that the current activity consists of ongoing volcanic steam cloud which may contain volcanic gases at Mt. Garet. Visitors will continue to smell volcanic gas while approaching the volcanic cone.  The Volcanic Alert Level (VAL) for Gaua volcano has been at Level 2 since 31st January 2018. The current observations are consistent with the activity of the Volcanic Alert Level 2. Level 2 indicates *'Major level of unrest ; Danger zone is on the volcanic cone'*. **With this current volcanic activity, it is a useful reminder that eruptions can occur with little or no warning.**  Gaua volcano is one of the active volcano in Vanuatu. Historically, the formation of Mount Garet active cone of and other small cinder cones in the SW part of the caldera has left a crescent-shaped caldera lake, Lake Letas. The symmetrical, flat-topped Mount Garet cone is topped by three active craters.  Advice to all tourism agencies, local authorities, people on Gaua and the general public with this current activity, the danger area remains at the **volcanic cone**. The level of risk for visitors accessing areas around Mt. Garet is high. Villages exposed to wind direction may expect volcanic gases and/or ash falls impact and other volcanic risk could occur at any time in such major unrest state.  The Vanuatu Meteorology and Geohazards Department will continue to closely monitor this volcano activity.

'My daughter and I were selling yellow rice when the earthquake struck, while my husband and my old son were still working outside of the house.  'It was so strong. I thought that the whole world was going to be destroyed. My daughter and I were stuck in the house. I was sure that we would end up dead.  'I was very badly shaken and couldn't stand up. Everything around me was shaking', says Rusmiati, recalling the traumatic events of 28 September 2018.  One of the quakes, a 7.5 magnitude tremor, triggered a tsunami. Huge waves struck Palu city and other settlements, sweeping away homes and buildings. And soil liquefaction ' a rare event in which the ground flows like liquid ' submerged many buildings in mudflows.  Rusmiati witnessed the effects of this devastating second quake. It had destroyed half of Lolu village, damaging nearly every home in the village, and killing at least 26 villagers.  It also swept away their livelihoods, displaced thousands of villagers and crippled essential services.  Rusmiati, alongside her family and others members of the village, spent two weeks sleeping in the open under tarpaulin. They spent a further six months living in tents while their home was restored.  **Islamic Relief provided lifesaving aid to survivors**  In Sulawesi, our emergency teams gave out food, water, and hygiene kits as well as items like tarpaulin and blankets ' reaching nearly 19,000 families.  We also provided special food for malnourished children and promoted good hygiene practices to stop the spread of disease.  In the months that followed the disaster, our focus turned to helping Sulawesi families to rebuild their lives and livelihoods.  Islamic Relief provided Rusmiati and her family with essential items such as blankets, hygiene kits and household tools and also helped to repair their home.  **We're continuing to restore lives in Indonesia**  We run an Islamic microfinance scheme in Sulawesi which gives families cash to set up small enterprises, whilst a separate programme supports others to launch businesses cultivating mushrooms. Rusmiati's family are part of the scheme, and were given cash to help them to reopen their yellow rice business.  With Islamic Relief's support, Rusmiati and other women from her village have been able establish a mushroom cultivation group. This is providing them with a reliable source of income and has helped to restore their livelihoods.  As well as giving survivors the support they need to earn a living once more, Islamic Relief is rebuilding schools in Pakuli which were destroyed by the tsunami.  Two years after the harrowing events of the earthquake, we have supported those affected so that they are able to resume normal life. However, others still face uncertain futures. Through our recovery plan which focuses on supporting communities to build brighter futures, we are doing all we can to help them.  Our current projects in Indonesia include helping families to regain their livelihoods, and rebuilding local economies and industries. We also provide comprehensive disaster risk reduction training to schools, religious buildings, and communities.

Each work plan is gender-sensitive, targets reducing inequity and incorporates activities that build resilience to disasters and climate change. Increasingly UNICEF is seeking to embed commitments into respective Ministry Business Plans and avoid parallel agency specific processes.   The Prime Minister's Office circulated the Vanuatu National Sustainable Development Plan (NSDP) to development partners to seek inputs. UNICEF coordinated the UN input and other development partners provided feedback. A request was made for the NSDP logical framework to be shared once ready for input. A transition document is expected to bridge the gap between the previous and future plans with a national validation summit planned for October/November.   Within the structure of the emerging UN Pacific Strategy, UNICEF Pacific has embarked on clarifying a matching 5-year (2018-2022) Multi-Country Programme Document for approval by the Executive Board in 2017. This will align with national NSDPs and guide programming priorities and commitments across the 14 Pacific Island Countries over the 5 year period. Multiple layers of consultations with key stakeholders including government, nongovernmental organisations, civil society organisations, and private sector, other UN Agencies, bilateral and multilaterals as well as children and youth will be undertaken.

3867214,"Monday 18 July -- Millions of children across Europe are in danger of respiratory disease, kidney disease and other health hazards as record-breaking temperatures sweep across the continent according to warnings from medics.  Save the Children said today that this assessment should be a warning call for leaders to take urgent action on the climate crisis, in order to reduce children's exposure to dangerous heatwaves and protect future generations.  The past week has seen children in France, Spain and Portugal face extreme heatwaves and wildfires that have forced tens of thousands of people from their homes[[i]]( , ). Already, [more than 360 people]( ) have died of the heat in Spain, where temperatures reached 47 degrees C at the end of last week[[ii]]( , ).  Meanwhile in the United Kingdom, for the first time in history, the Met office issued a ['Red' warning]( ) for exceptional heat as parts of the country are expected to experience temperatures of 40 degrees C today.    The climate crisis is making these kinds of extreme weather events more frequent and severe. According to research by Save the Children and Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), [*Born into the Climate Crisis*]( ), on average under the initial Paris Agreement reduction pledges, children who were born in 2020 are likely to face almost seven times as many scorching heatwaves and twice as many wildfires as their grandparents.  The more that children are exposed to extreme heat, the greater their risk of respiratory and kidney disease, fever, and electrolyte imbalance, which can disrupt a range of critical functions, including heart and neurological functions, according to a Lancet study[[iii]]( , ). It can also cause severe dehydration, exhaustion and heatstroke, which if untreated can quickly damage the brain, heart, kidneys and muscles, being fatal in some cases[[iv]]( , ).  Keeping hydrated, staying as cool as possible and staying out of the sun can all lower the chances of becoming sick[[v]]( , ).  And if we take urgent action to limit warming temperatures to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, we will reduce the additional lifetime exposure of babies to heatwaves by 45%, and to wildfires by 10%, Save the Children said.  Yolande Wright, Director of Child Poverty and Climate at Save the Children, said: *""Sadly, the reality of these heatwaves is not simply more leisure time in the park or on the beach. These high temperatures are dangerous to our health and to our lives -- particularly for children, who are more vulnerable due to their ongoing physical development and lower capacity to regulate body temperature.*""  Children affected by inequality and discrimination, such as those from lower-income families or refugee communities, are more at risk, Save the Children said, because they are most likely to lack access to quality healthcare, have underlying health conditions or be malnourished.  They are also often left behind when adapting to the heat. Across Europe and in the UK, families on lower incomes are less likely to have access to cooler, more spacious housing, and cooling systems such as air conditioning units or fans.  Skyrocketing energy costs and the universal cost of living crisis are also seeing families forced to make critical decisions between using electricity to power fans, fridges and freezers and feeding their children, the child rights group said.  Yolande Wright said: *""**As the world gets warmer, and no sign of sufficient action to limit warming, it is children, with their whole lives ahead of them, who bear the brunt. But the climate crisis also disproportionately impacts children from low- and middle-income countries, and in disadvantaged communities.*  * ""But there is hope: the world has the resources and tools required to ensure every child's wellbeing on a healthy planet for generations to come. We need leaders to do everything in their power to limit warming temperatures to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, and to set out proper plans to help communities adapt to our new normal.*  *""We know fundamental changes are needed to address both widening inequalities and climate chaos. Otherwise we are failing our children.""*  ENDS  NOTES TO EDITORS:  Find information from the World Health Organisation on keeping cool to avoid heatstroke and illness during heatwaves[ here]( ( ))",['Heat Wave'],"['Health', 'Protection and Human Rights']","['France', 'Portugal', 'Spain', 'United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland']",News and Press Release

3710850,"Ibrahim Ahmaid  After the devastating Beirut explosion last year, the population continues to face a number of crises. Since the blast, NORCAP experts have been working to coordinate humanitarian efforts and securing housing land and property rights during a tumultuous time.  Six months have passed since an explosion of 2750 tons of badly stored ammonium nitrate took Beirut by surprise. The explosion that shook the centrally located port of the city was unprecedented, causing the death of at least 204 people, 7500 injuries, USD 15 billion in property damage, and leaving an estimated 300 000 people homeless.  **An influx of assistance**  The ongoing political and economic crisis in Lebanon had already been exacerbated by the pandemic. Repercussions from the explosion amplified the dire situation, putting pressure on the international community to act fast to help those in need.  The initial response saw the influx of several actors from civil society who did not necessarily understand humanitarian principles and instruments. Additionally, several actors already working for the Lebanon Crisis Response Plan had shifted efforts to respond to the needs of the port explosion victims, but were lacking humanitarian and emergency expertise.  Together, these factors affected the speed and efficiency of the response, making coordination of the help efforts pouring into the country more important than ever.  **An area-based approach**  NORCAP has deployed several experts to help reduce the gaps and overlaps in the assistance delivered by humanitarian organizations. Carolina Mansur was one of those working to coordinate the international response.  In the early recovery efforts in Beirut, the NORCAP expert has been deployed to UN Habitat. Here, she has been working to make use of the organisation's expertise on urban contexts, while also contributing to underpin the agency's support to the Government of Lebanon in developing a national urban policy.  In Carolina's work, it has been central to promote the implementation of projects using an area-based approach. This implies looking at multiple needs within one area, rather than a sector or target group.  'Communities affected by crisis have a holistic view of their recovery, which means it is important to have an understanding of the overall needs. In order to achieve this, it is vital to improve collaboration between the different sectors and stakeholders,' says Carolina.  An area-based approach is especially applicable in urban contexts, she explains. It is often associated with places similar to Lebanon, where there is a strong presence of local authorities and the existence of complex relationships. In these contexts, narrow external interventions can have strong, unintended impacts on other sectors.  'International response and interventions should to a much greater extent be developed through applying an integrated lens.""  **The return home**  Despite international and local efforts to help rehouse the victims of the explosion, many are still unable to go back to their homes. Lebanon was grappling with issues related to housing, land and property rights already before the blast.  'Six months after the explosion, we are still experiencing additional housing, land and property issues. Many tenants have become indebted, as they have themselves paid for repairs and restructure. In some cases, repairs that were made increased the standard of the building, which led to landlords wanting to increase rent', says Jenny Bjerlestam.  Many of the neighbourhoods heavily damaged by the Beirut Port explosions are located in the old districts of Beirut, which are also high in land value. Thanks to pre-existing rental conditions, these neighbourhoods accommodated residents of all income levels and demographic backgrounds. Many of these residents are unable to afford moving out or signing new rental contracts with updated rental rates.  Jenny's expertise has been particularly important in the protection of marginalized and disadvantaged groups.  'After the blast, people living in the affected areas reported being approached by brokers wanting to procure property for large amounts of cash', she says.",['Technological Disaster'],"['Protection and Human Rights', 'Recovery and Reconstruction', 'Shelter and Non-Food Items']",['Lebanon'],News and Press Release
3676406,"**Geneva, 6 October 2020** -  Since gaining independence in 2011, the brutal conflict across South Sudan has caused incalculable suffering to the civilian population, resulted in staggering levels of acute food insecurity, and malnutrition, noted the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan.  ""With 7.5 million South Sudanese currently requiring humanitarian assistance, we have found that food insecurity in Western Bahr el Ghazal, Jonglei, and Central Equatoria States is linked directly to the conflict and therefore almost entirely human-induced,"" said Commission Chair Yasmin Sooka. ""It is quite clear that both Government and opposition forces have deliberately used the starvation of civilians as a method of warfare in these States, sometimes as an instrument to punish non-aligning communities, as in the case of Jonglei,"" she added.  In the first report of its kind by a UN panel, the Commission's [**46-page report**]( ) released today documents how, between January 2017 and November 2018, Government forces intentionally deprived Fertit and Luo communities living under the control of the opposition in Western Bahr el Ghazal State of critical resources, in acts amounting to collective punishment and starvation as a method of warfare, the report finds. Government commanders also authorised their soldiers to reward themselves by pillaging objects indispensable to the survival of these rural populations.  ""Sustained attacks were carried out against numerous towns and villages across Western Bahr el Ghazal State over a number of years, which resulted in significant numbers of deaths, rapes, and the destruction, arson, and looting of properties,"" said Commissioner Andrew Clapham. ""The resultant food insecurity compounded the physical insecurity, leaving civilians with no alternative but to flee. These violations formed part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against the civilian population in Western Bahr el Ghazal, and can amount to crimes against humanity,"" he added.  To address these and other violations and crimes documented by the Commission over the course of its five mandates, the Commission also released a [**44-page report**]( ) today on transitional justice and accountability, which aims to serve as a roadmap to energise the overdue implementation of the key commitments made in Chapter V of the Revitalised Peace Agreement which is a key pillar of South Sudan's transition.  ""The on-going failure to address underlying causes of the conflict has fuelled the political competition for South Sudan's resources and corruption between political elites driving ethnic divisions and violence, and deepening impunity in the country,"" said Commissioner Barney Afako. ""Without the timely implementation of an inclusive and holistic transitional justice process, as envisioned in the Peace Agreement, sustainable peace for South Sudan will remain elusive,"" he added.  ENDS  *The Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan was established by the Human Rights Council in March 2016 and extended in March 2017, and for further years in March 2018, March 2019, and June 2020, with a mandate to determine and report the facts and circumstances of, collect and preserve evidence of, and clarify responsibility for alleged gross violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes, including sexual and gender-based violence and ethnic violence, with a view to ending impunity and providing accountability.*  **For media queries, please contact:**  JUBA: Yousuf Syed Khan,   or +211 917 739 573              GENEVA: Rolando Gomez,   or +41 79 477 4411    More information about the UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan, and @UNCHRSS on Twitter","['Drought', 'Epidemic', 'Other']","['Food and Nutrition', 'Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding', 'Protection and Human Rights']",['South Sudan'],News and Press Release
3676599,"Human Rights Council      Forty-fifth session       14 September'7 October 2020      Agenda item 4       Human rights situations that require the Council's attention  **Summary**   Since December 2013, the armed conflict in South Sudan has provoked a dire humanitarian crisis which has led to the displacement of nearly 4 million women, men, and children. Around 1.67 million people are currently displaced internally, languishing in camps that barely meet their basic needs and subsisting on rapidly diminishing humanitarian aid. South Sudan enjoys the unenviable status of representing the third largest refugee crisis in the world, with over 2.2 million people having fled abroad as refugees and asylum seekers. At present, 7.5 million residents now require humanitarian assistance, and 1.3 million children under the age of five years are predicted to suffer from malnutrition, which is the highest rate of child malnutrition in the past four years.    On-going armed conflict in Central Equatoria, Jonglei, Lakes, Unity, Western Bahr el Ghazal, and Warrap States, as well as in the Greater Pibor Administrative Area, continues to obstruct the work of humanitarian actors struggling to ameliorate the crisis. Coinciding with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Sudan on 5 April 2020, prices for staple foods and basic commodities have also escalated drastically, further rendering vulnerable civilians food insecure.    Over the past seven years, the brutal armed conflict has impacted mainly on the civilian population, resulting in acute food insecurity and malnutrition across South Sudan which is manifested by several causes, including both intentional and indirect factors. There has been a spike in food insecurity in Western Bahr el Ghazal and Jonglei States which is linked directly to the conflict and therefore almost entirely humaninduced.    Pervasive human rights violations, as well as deliberate strategies on the part of both Government and opposition forces to use starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, amounting to acts constituting war crimes, have contributed to the food insecurity in Western Bahr el Ghazal, Jonglei, and Central Equatoria States.    Recognising the need to address the crisis, signatories to the Revitalised Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan largely dedicated Chapter III to humanitarian aid and, on 1 October 2019, launched a plan for the return and reintegration of internally displaced persons and refugees titled 'the National Framework on Return, Resettlement and Reintegration'.

1634691,"The Secretary for Development, Mr Paul Chan, today (August 1) inspected the underground stormwater storage tank and related facilities at the Happy Valley Underground Stormwater Storage Scheme of the Drainage Services Department (DSD) to learn more about the flood prevention measures undertaken by the department in response to the threat of Typhoon Nida to Hong Kong.   Mr Chan received a report from the Director of Drainage Services, Mr Edwin Tong, on the progress of the Scheme. The DSD commenced the Scheme in September 2012 to alleviate the flood risk in the Happy Valley and Wan Chai areas. The project is divided into two phases. Phase 1 of the underground stormwater storage tank has been in operation since March 2015. Phase 2 is under way and is expected to be completed before the rainy season in 2017.   Mr Chan learnt that to get prepared for Typhoon Nida and the high tides, the DSD has deployed staff to areas susceptible to storm surges, including Tai O, Praya Road in Lei Yue Mun, Kar Wo Lei in Tuen Mun and other coastal low-lying areas, to implement precautionary measures to reduce the risk of flooding. The DSD will implement emergency flood relief measures at relevant locations immediately once storm surge alerts are issued by the Hong Kong Observatory. Furthermore, it will activate the Emergency Calls Centre when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 is in force or under inclement weather to strengthen its manpower in handling flooding reports. Contractors will stand by in flood-prone areas to handle flooding incidents in a timely manner.   Mr Chan said that heavy rainfall may also cause landslides. In light of this risk, the Geotechnical Engineering Office under the Civil Engineering and Development Department has reminded the maintenance departments and owners of private slopes to adopt precautionary measures and complete the necessary inspection and maintenance works before the onset of the wet season. The Office will also activate the Emergency Control Centre to handle landslide incidents when Tropical Cyclone Warning Signal No. 8 is hoisted.   Regarding tree management, Mr Chan said that the relevant departments completed the tree risk assessment in accordance with the Guidelines for Tree Risk Assessment and Management Arrangement before the onset of the wet season. Once the inclement weather is over, the departments will inspect the affected trees again and undertake timely mitigation measures to ensure public safety.   Mr Chan understands that colleagues from various departments will work hard when typhoon signals are in force and under adverse weather. He reminded site personnel to complete precautionary measures immediately to minimise the typhoon's impacts on the public.   He urged members of the public to stay alert to the changing weather conditions. They are advised to report any flooding that comes to their notice to the DSD by calling its 24-hour drainage hotline at 2300 1110. They should also stay away from slopes during heavy rainfall. In the event of a landslide or tree failure, they should call the Police immediately. They can also report problematic trees to the Government Call Centre at 1823.

3902168,"**H2H Network strengthens the humanitarian response to the floods in Pakistan**  Following the devastating floods in Pakistan, the H2H Network has activated its fund mechanism to strengthen the humanitarian response and recovery. H2H funding will enable four network members to provide services addressing inclusion, information management and analysis as well as Community Engagement and Accountability. Services are freely available to all responders as part of the funded package. Project activities will be completed by March 2023. The H2H Network's Executive Director Kim Scriven said, 'Since the start of the flooding in Pakistan in June 2022, we have been closely following the crisis. We have seen the ongoing need for H2H services to support and enable the humanitarian community, particularly as we enter the longer term, with many vulnerable people still displaced and in need of assistance. The services provided in this package will enhance capacity in Pakistan, drive accountability, and help ensure an appropriate response for the most vulnerable.'  **Details:**  The four funded H2H Members will provide the following services to the humanitarian response in the Horn of Africa:  Fondation Hirondelle will produce and disseminate life-saving content and in-depth reports on the floods via radios stations, online media, television, print and social media.  HelpAge International will ensure that older people and persons with disabilities have improved access to life-saving assistance as well as increased resilience.  CLEAR Global will improve the evidence basis for language-aware community engagement and accountability.  RedR UK will strengthen local response capacity as well as build resilience and promote Disaster Risk Reduction.   **Background:**  Since mid-June, Pakistan has been experiencing an extreme monsoon rainfall season, resulting in uncontrollable flash floods and landslides across the country. Over 33 million people are affected by the disaster, with close to eight million people displaced, over 1,600 people dead and nearly 13,000 people injured. The most affected districts are located in Sindh, Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Over 2 million houses, 25,000 schools, and 13,000 km of roads have been destroyed or damaged. The rising public health challenges raise the risk of further deaths. Consequently, more than 20 million people require humanitarian assistance, with the UN's flash appeal with a substantial increase (Acaps and revised UN Flash Appeal).   To better assist the affected population with an efficient, impactful, and accountable humanitarian response, there is a need for information management and analysis within the national and international response community. This includes affecting the evolving public health situation, which is hampered by a lack of information and affects the coordination efforts. Needs related to Community Engagement and Accountability, protection and inclusion, have also been flagged as requiring H2H services to support the broader response.  The H2H Member's independent, cross-cutting services are well-suited to address these gaps and challenges. The network brings together nearly 60 high-quality, independent humanitarian service providers who enable efficient, impactful and accountable aid during a crisis by facilitating and resourcing humanitarian-to-humanitarian (H2H) services for the wider system.   The H2H Fund is a funding mechanism for network members to activate service packages to improve humanitarian assistance efficiently. Past service packages have been funded for Cyclone Idai in Mozambique, the Ebola epidemic in DR Congo, the security crisis in Burkina Faso, conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, Covid-19, the earthquake in Haiti, and the humanitarian crisis in Tigray, Ethiopia.   The network and its fund are supported by UK aid - from the British people.

2997054,"In the last three decades, the Earth has experienced record hot temperatures, with 2017 the third warmest year in recorded history. Rising temperatures can create deadly conditions for vulnerable populations, especially the elderly, infants and young children, pregnant women, those with chronic health challenges or disabilities, and those who work outside. When combined with other environmental challenges like air and water pollution, heat waves can threaten food security, increase demand for water and energy, and strain public services.

3898952,"ABUJA/NEW YORK, 21 October 2022' More than 2.5 million people in Nigeria are in need of humanitarian assistance ' 60 per cent of which are children ' and are at increased risk of waterborne diseases, drowning and malnutrition due to the most severe flooding in the past decade, UNICEF warned today.  The floods, which have affected 34 out of the 36 states in the country, have displaced 1.3 million people. Over 600 people have lost their lives and over 200,000 houses have either been partially or fully damaged. Cases of diarrhoea and water-borne diseases, respiratory infection, and skin diseases have already been on the rise. In the north-eastern states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe alone, a total of 7,485 cases of cholera and 319 associated deaths were reported as of 12 October. As rains are expected to continue for several weeks, humanitarian needs are also expected to rise.  'Children and adolescents in flood-affected areas are in an extremely vulnerable situation,' said Cristian Munduate, UNICEF Representative in Nigeria. ""They are particularly at risk of waterborne diseases and emotional and psychological distress. UNICEF is working closely with the Government and other partners to provide life-saving assistance to those who are most in need.'    The floods are adding another layer of complexity to an already precarious humanitarian situation in the country. Immediate priority needs for children include health, water, sanitation, and hygiene; as well as shelter and food. Additional funding and resources are required to respond to growing needs and to sustain ongoing humanitarian interventions, with a focus on the most vulnerable, including children with disabilities.  According to UNICEF's Children's Climate Risk Index (CCRI), Nigeria is considered at 'extremely high risk' of the impacts of climate change, ranking second out of 163 countries.  Children in 'extremely high risk' countries face a deadly combination of exposure to multiple climate and environmental shocks combined with high levels of underlying child vulnerability, due to inadequate essential services, such as water and sanitation, healthcare and education.  To date, UNICEF has supported the government response in three affected States ' Jigawa, Niger, and Kaduna, including through the provision of cash assistance, distribution of cholera kits, government-led mobile health teams, temporary learning centres and learning kits and cholera kits. With additional support, UNICEF can scale up its response in other states to provide lifesaving medical equipment and essential medicines, chlorination of water and sanitation supplies, as well as to support the prevention of and response to sexual and gender-based violence.  **Media contacts**  Geoffrey Njoku     Communication Specialist    UNICEF Nigeria     Tel: +234 803 525 0288    Email:    Matias Lindemann    UNICEF New York    Tel: +1 917 547 2846    Email:","['Epidemic', 'Flash Flood', 'Flood']","['Health', 'Protection and Human Rights']",['Nigeria'],News and Press Release
2767144,"NEW YORK, 31 August 2018 ' The large number of extreme weather events around the world, including floods in southern India, wildfires in the western United States and heatwaves across much of the northern hemisphere, are putting children in immediate danger, as well as jeopardizing their futures, UNICEF warned today.  'In any crisis, children are among the most vulnerable, and the extreme weather events we are seeing around the world are no exception,' said Ted Chaiban, UNICEF Director of Programmes. 'Over the past few months, we have seen a stark vision of the world we are creating for future generations. As more extreme weather events increase the number of emergencies and humanitarian crises, it is children who will pay the highest price,' he added.    June and July saw record high temperatures set across much of the northern hemisphere, with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reporting the first six months of the year have made it the hottest La Niña year on record.    From North America to East Asia, and from the Arctic Circle to Europe, large parts of the globe have experienced heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, floods, and landslides resulting in injury and loss of life, environmental damage and widespread loss to livelihoods including harvest losses. Countries in Central America and the Caribbean are preparing for the peak of the hurricane season while still trying to recover from the devastating 2017 season, which was the costliest on record.    While individual weather events cannot specifically be attributed to climate change, the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather -- including recent high temperatures, intense rains and slow-moving weather fronts -- are in line with predictions of how human activities are affecting the global climate.    Such events can cause death and devastation, and can also contribute to the increased spread of major killers of children, such as malnutrition, malaria and diarrhoea. And as these extreme climate events increase in frequency and magnitude, the risks to children will likely outpace global capacity to mitigate them as well as to provide humanitarian response. 'As the world experiences a steady rise in climate-driven extreme weather events, it is children's lives and futures that will be the most disrupted,' added Chaiban. 'Therefore, it's vital that Governments and the international community take concrete steps to safeguard children's future and their rights. The worst impacts of climate change are not inevitable, but the time for action is now.' Numerous studies have documented that human-induced climate change has increased the frequency and severity of heatwaves across the globe. Children are especially at risk as they adjust more slowly than adults to changes in environmental heat, and are more susceptible to heat-related health risks, with children under 12 months old particularly vulnerable. Infants and small children are more likely to die or suffer from heatstroke because they are unable to regulate their body temperature and control their surrounding environment. Extreme heat conditions also increase the need for safe and reliable drinking water, while in many cases rendering such water more scarce through evaporation.    Floods threaten children's survival and development, with direct impacts including injuries and death by drowning. Beyond these immediate risks, floods compromise safe water supplies and damage sanitation facilities, increasing the risk of diarrhoea and other disease outbreaks, as well as impacting children's access to education. Damage to housing endangers children's well-being, particularly if emergency shelter is either scarce or inadequate. It also destroys infrastructure, making it difficult to move lifesaving assistance where needed.    Droughts have multiple effects on poor families and communities. Crops fail, livestock die and income drops, leading to food insecurity for the poor as well as rising food prices globally. Water becomes scarce and the lack of food and water, as well as inequitable access to these necessities, can result in migration and social disorder, with children among the most vulnerable to the consequences of these effects.    UNICEF's agenda for action on climate change include:  - Strengthening health systems to respond to a changing climate and more frequent extreme weather events, including the scaling-up of information platforms to track the increased range of disease vectors, increased deployment of vaccines and an emphasis on disaster resilient construction. By strengthening the ability to provide health services to children in the aftermath of extreme weather events, we lessen longer-term impacts.  - Increasing the ability of educational services to be delivered in the aftermath of extreme weather events including through the use of disaster-resilient construction and the use of decentralized renewable energy.  - Increasing investment in and delivery of climate resilient agricultural, water and sanitation services. This includes a greater focus on understanding changing crop and water availability patterns as a result of climate events, providing access to financial mechanisms such as disaster risk insurance for farmers, and the use of decentralized low-carbon water supply and treatment options.  * Putting in place measures to protect children who have been displaced, migrate or are refugees as a result of climate change or climate-related impacts.  * Providing children and youth with climate change education and training to take advantage of the opportunities in climate and environmental response including renewable energy, early warning systems and the circular economy.  - Aligning and coordinating work on climate change adaptation, preparedness and disaster risk reduction. Planning and policies on climate change preparedness, response, and recovery must consider the full spectrum of children's needs before, during, and after severe climate events.  - Advocating for the rights and vulnerabilities of children to be reflected in national strategies, commitments and action plans including Intended Nationally Determined Contributions and National Adaptation /Mitigation Plans.  - Increasing understanding of the links between climate change and impacts on children; both the short term physiological and developmental effects and longer-term economic and intergenerational impacts. Responding to climate change is not only a moral imperative but makes economic sense.  - Deepen the evidence base on the links not only between climate action and global weather events but also between a low-carbon economy and the potential for employment generation, local air pollution and national energy security. Responding to climate change makes sense from the perspectives of national security, domestic economy, and the health of children.","['Drought', 'Flood', 'Heat Wave']",['Climate Change and Environment'],['World'],News and Press Release

The risk of violence, exploitation and abuse is also increasing. Millions of people lack access to safe water and sanitation across the region.   - UNICEF will work on strengthening preparedness and risk-informed programming to better anticipate, reduce and respond to disasters in the region. UNICEF will also support governments and communities to control the spread of COVID-19 and address the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic.   - UNICEF is seeking US$117.2 million to respond to these critical needs, including US$85.7 million for the COVID-19 response and US$31.5 million to address non-COVID-related humanitarian needs. Twenty-five countries and territories are directly covered by this regional appeal.  **IN NEED**  **500,000** additional children have SAM due to COVID-19  **6.9 million** children are not immunized against measles   **369 million** people lack access to basic hygiene services   **114 million** children/adolescents lack access to education   FUNDING REQUIREMENTS **US$ 117.2 million**  **HUMANITARIAN SITUATION**  Countries in East Asia and the Pacific bear the brunt of disasters triggered by natural hazards worldwide, with over 1.6 billion people in the region affected by natural disasters since 2000. Several countries situated along the Pacific Ring of Fire are prone to earthquakes, volcanic activities and tsunamis. The region is significantly affected by the negative impacts of climate change, with cyclones, floods and droughts on the rise, both in frequency and intensity. Countries in the Mekong Delta have faced recurrent drought in recent years: In 2020, over 685,000 people were affected by drought-related saltwater intrusion in Viet Nam. In the same year, two devastating tropical cyclones in the Pacific and the Philippines affected over 830,000 people. In addition, chronic protracted humanitarian situations due to unresolved conflict and political instability continue to affect the lives of millions of children and their families, and lead to food insecurity and lack of access to basic life-saving services, with profound impacts on the most vulnerable.  These disasters occured as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold and compounded existing vulnerabilities. Across the region, 50 million people urgently require access to safe drinking water and 369 million people lack access to basic hygiene services. The number of severely malnourished children increased from 1.2 to 1.7 million over the course of 2020. An additional 21 million children (over the existing 44 million) are at acute risk of falling into poverty with severe consequences for their well-being and development. While most governments have started to reopen schools, 114 million children across the region are still without access to formal education. Before COVID-19, 71 per cent of children and 40 per cent of women in Southeast Asia and 68 per cent of women in the Pacific experienced violence and 10 to 20 per cent of children experienced mental health conditions. During the pandemic, household violence and mental health issues have reportedly worsened. Several countries have postponed vaccination campaigns, leaving unimmunized children susceptible to life-threatening diseases such as measles and polio and increasing the risk of outbreaks.","['Drought', 'Earthquake', 'Epidemic']","['Disaster Management', 'Education', 'Food and Nutrition', 'Health', 'Protection and Human Rights', 'Water Sanitation Hygiene']","['Cambodia', 'Cook Islands', ""Democratic People's Republic of Korea"", 'Fiji', 'Indonesia', 'Kiribati', ""Lao People's Democratic Republic (the)"", 'Malaysia', 'Marshall Islands', 'Micronesia (Federated States of)', 'Mongolia', 'Nauru', 'Niue (New Zealand)', 'Palau', 'Papua New Guinea', 'Philippines', 'Samoa', 'Solomon Islands', 'Thailand', 'Timor-Leste', 'Tokelau', 'Tonga', 'Tuvalu', 'Vanuatu', 'Viet Nam']",Appeal

'While we welcome the continued international support to Lebanon through a new funding mechanism to help the most vulnerable, this is far from enough to help the country survive the full force of its ongoing economic and political crisis. Tens of thousands of people who were self-sufficient have been pushed into poverty and destitution, with a shocking rise in child labour, hunger and malnutrition. People we work with tell us they are skipping their meals, postponing critical healthcare and fearing homelessness because they can no longer pay the rent. It is crucial that the announced emergency response plan is funded fully to cover immediate humanitarian needs and help people cope.  'But band aid solutions won't help Lebanon get out of the abyss. The formation of a Lebanese government and the implementation of wide-ranging governance reforms is the key to unlocking the long-term, structural international support needed to create jobs, provide services and social protection. Only that can avert a total humanitarian disaster.

'It was extremely scary, I've never felt anything like this,' said John Lilo, Acting Country Director with Save the Children in the Solomon Islands.  'The shaking lasted for about 15 seconds and I thought our whole house was going to collapse. Thankfully it didn't and there are few reports of damage here in Honiara.  'However, this was a massive earthquake and the whole country is on alert for further aftershocks.

The Solomon Islands government is carrying out assessment flights to determine which communities have been worst affected. Save the Children humanitarian personnel are ready to respond if required.   'We know from our experience in previous emergencies that children will be the most vulnerable and could face serious protection and psychological threats,' Mr Lilo said.  'The Solomon Islands government and agencies like Save the Children have put considerable effort into building a robust disaster preparedness and response system for the country. This machinery is now being activated.  'We have a strong team on the ground and we know the country well.

1377866,"**A regional tsunami warning exercise involving sixteen* countries of the Pacific is currently taking place from 1 to 5 February to provide participants with the opportunity to test and give feedback on the Northwest Pacific Tsunami Advisory Center (NWPTAC) enhanced forecasting products.**  Named [PacWave 16]( ), the multi-scenario exercise consists of major tsunamis originating in various seismic zones of the Pacific to complement previous scenarios in other places. Participating Member States have selected either a distant or a regional source event which will cause the greatest impact to their country. They will then analyze the information received to assess the threat to their nation and take actions as they deem appropriate.  Not only will this allow countries to increase their readiness and raise awareness, especially for communities at risk that need to be prepared for the next tsunami, but it will also help them assess the efficiency of the Pacific Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System (PTWS), established under the auspices of UNESCO's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission.  In order to provide timely services, alerts (warnings and watches) have been based primarily on seismic data and the rapid determination of an earthquake's hypocenter and magnitude, followed by the monitoring of coastal sea-level gauges to confirm a tsunami and its severity. Over the last 5-10 years, however, seismic and sea-level data availability, analysis methods and communications have improved significantly. Additionally, better and faster numerical models are now able to provide much more accurate forecasts of tsunami impacts along different coasts.  PacWave 16 will test the new NWPTAC enhanced products, which consist of an initial text message prepared from pre-established tsunami database information.It is followed by text messages accompanied by graphical products that are based on real-time simulation techniques. PacWave16 and a similar exercise in 2017 are experimental phases of a full transition to the new products due in 2018.  The PTWS was established in 1965 by UNESCO's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission following the deadly tsunami that hit the coasts of Chile and Japan in 1960. The purpose of the warning system is to facilitate the speedy dissemination of alerts across the region and to support countries' ability to respond to and mitigate tsunamis locally. Simulation exercises were carried out in 2006, 2008, 2011, 2013 and 2015.  Nearly 75% of deadly tsunami events occur in the Pacific Ocean and connected seas. Local tsunamis occur in the Pacific every two years on average. Major events affecting the whole Pacific Ocean occur several times every century. Over the past six years, four devastating tsunamis hit the region: 2009 in Samoa and Tonga, 2010 in Chile, 2011 in Japan, and 2013 in the Solomon Islands.  \***  More information: [PacWave16]( )  *\*The 16 countries currently participating are: Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, China, Federated States of Micronesia, France (French Polynesia), Indonesia, Malaysia, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Republic of Korea (South), Russian Federation, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam.*",['Tsunami'],['Disaster Management'],"['Brunei Darussalam', 'Cambodia', 'China', 'French Polynesia (France)', 'Indonesia', 'Malaysia', 'Micronesia (Federated States of)', 'Palau', 'Papua New Guinea', 'Philippines', 'Republic of Korea', 'Russian Federation', 'Singapore', 'Solomon Islands', 'Thailand', 'Viet Nam', 'World']",News and Press Release

3701388,"**Summary**  The Security Council, in its resolution [2514 (2020)]( (2020)), requested the Secretary-General to conduct an independent strategic review of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) to assess the challenges to peace and security in the country and provide detailed recommendations for the possible reconfiguration of the Mission's civilian, police and military components to account for developments in the peace process. In response to that request, the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and the Department of Peace Operations assembled a team to carry out the review. The team conducted extensive consultations with a wide range of stakeholders, holding over 150 remote meetings with the senior leadership and staff of the Mission, the United Nations country team, United Nations offices in the region and all relevant United Nations entities based at United Nations Headquarters. It also held remote meetings with the African Union Commission and a number of its specialized institutions, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), Member States and mechanisms involved in the peace process; representatives of Security Council members and other members of the diplomatic community in both Juba and New York; as well as think tanks and civil society organizations working on South Sudan.   **Challenges to peace and security in South Sudan**  The Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (Revitalized Peace Agreement) outlines a clear vision for reforms that, if fully implemented, would help to address the underlying drivers of conflict and begin the transformation of the country. However, implementation has been slow and uneven. The timelines stipulated in the Revitalized Peace Agreement were, in some cases, unrealistic. Nevertheless, the parties have failed to meet any of those timelines and have primarily focused on implementing those provisions of the Revitalized Peace Agreement that outline elite power-sharing arrangements rather than those that would promote accountability, facilitate a smoother delivery of humanitarian assistance and strengthen financial management and overall governance. The parties agreed that 35 per cent of the appointments to the Revitalized Transitional Government of Nati onal Unity would be women, but that provision has not been adhered to in the appointment of cabinet ministers and governors.   The current economic crisis in South Sudan has decimated the resources and resilience of its population and made it more difficult for the Government to finance many aspects of the peace process. More fundamentally, the parties have not demonstrated sufficient political will to address issues critical to longer-term peace and security. Based on the past record of the parties involved, international donors have been reluctant to finance the implementation of the Revitalized Peace Agreement, fearing that funds will be used to fuel violence rather than foster peace.   Therefore, while the Revitalized Peace Agreement and an earlier 2017 cessation of hostilities agreement have been successful in curbing large-scale political violence and bringing most parties to the conflict into dialogue, they have not transformed the underlying dynamics that contributed to the outbreak of civil war in South Sudan. The country continues to be destabilized by an oversized and dysfunctional security sector and remains awash with small arms and light weapons. Few economic opportunities exist outside the civil service and the war economy, leaving young people vulnerable to recruitment by armed groups. While violence directly attributable to the parties to the civil war has ebbed, intercommunal violence has risen sharply over the past year and, in many cases, has been directly fuelled by national political actors as an extension of political tensions and disputes. Human rights violations have continued unabated, with deeply concerning restrictions on civil society and media organizations.   Moreover, violence could escalate in the lead-up to elections, which are expected to take place in 2022 or 2023. In short, while advances have been made, South Sudan has not yet reached a point where continued progress is assured, where peace is stable or where civilians are benefiting from the agreements reached on paper.  **Opportunities, progress and the contribution of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan to peace and security**  There are some opportunities for progress in South Sudan. Although the implementation of the Revitalized Peace Agreement has been limited, it has been successful in that it has brought most political parties in the country together in an ongoing process of dialogue and fostered agreement, at least on paper, on the way forward. The Agreement contains a road map for durable change in the country. Th e national dialogue, as a parallel track-two peace process, has presented citizens with a much-needed opportunity to discuss the root causes of violence and make recommendations on how the broad commitments enshrined in the Agreement should be implemented to address conflict drivers. More generally, the South Sudanese population is exhausted by war, broadly supportive of peace efforts and eager for opportunities to rebuild and experience the dividends of peace. While institutions at the local level are weak and the authority of community leaders has been threatened by displacement and years of conflict, there is also a history of local negotiation and peace agreements that can be built upon. In the short term, local peace agreements can improve trust and prevent or reduce levels of violence. In the medium term, there is some potential for local peace agreements to trickle up.   In this environment, rife with challenges but not without opportunities, UNMISS has been able to contribute concretely to peace and security. Many stakeholders who were consulted agreed that the Mission's work to ensure security at sites for the protection of civilians has undoubtedly saved lives, while its increasingly integrated and mobile patrols likewise have contributed to an improvement in the physical protection of civilians. Moreover, the Mission has increasingly been linking subnational dialogue activities with political analysis and outreach, thereby making those activities more effective. In efforts to improve the inclusivity and sustainability of the peace process and expand civic space, UNMISS has supported the development of political parties and hosted a series of grass-roots dialogues for which it has brought civil society actors from around the country to Juba.   The Mission has worked with humanitarian and development agencies to increase awareness of sexual and gender-based violence, conflict-related sexual violence and the rights of all civilians, including women and children. In the course of the review, Mission officials noted that the rapid investigation team created within the UNMISS Human Rights Division has enabled it to more quickly deploy and scale up capacity for investigating human rights violations, including conflict-related sexual violence. In addition, a wide range of interlocutors recognized that the UNMISS Rule of Law Advisory Section had made important contributions to improving accountability through its support for mobile courts, training and technical advice to South Sudanese stakeholders in legal reforms. Humanitarian and development actors also widely affirmed that the presence and activities of UNMISS contributed to an environment conducive to the delivery of humanitarian assistance.   There was broad agreement among the interlocutors of the review team that there was a direct link between justice, accountability and sustainable peace, and, therefore, that renewed efforts were needed to achieve justice for past crimes. Chapter V of the Revitalized Peace Agreement contains a road map for the parties and the African Union Commission to establish a body to be known as the Hybrid Court for South Sudan.   Negotiations between the African Union Commission and the Government of South Sudan on the establishment of the Court have reached an advanced stage, but n o agreement has thus far been signed. Given the divided support for the establishment of the Court, continued international engagement would be needed to reduce delays and keep the process on track. Ideally, that effort would be led by the African Union with support from bodies of the United Nations system.   **Recommendations for the reconfiguration of the Mission**  After considering the environment in South Sudan and the Mission's demonstrated past performance, the review team concluded that the current four pillars of the Mission's mandate remain valid overall. However, a number of adjustments to its mandate, activities and capabilities within those four pillars would enhance the Mission's impact. Moreover, it is critical that the United Nations, in particular UNMISS, enhance its role in support of the IGAD-led peace process. This is all the more necessary as the countries of the region are facing their own internal challenges and may not be able to devote the same level of attention to South Sudan as they have in the past.   Throughout the review, the team was cognizant of the primacy of politics in the pursuit of lasting peace in South Sudan. Therefore, the team strove to identify methods of increasing political leverage to help to move the process forward, without losing sight of the reality that fundamental and structural changes can only be brought about if South Sudanese stakeholders fully own the process and demonstrate political will. No amount of external pressure or support can substitute that requirement. In so doing, the review team built on the Secretary-General's priorities to deepen partnerships between the United Nations and the African Union and enhance integration within the United Nations system.   In practical terms, the review team recommends establishing a strong compact with the region and the African Union, including its relevant specialized institutions. Building on the significant level of coordination that already exists between the Mission and the wider United Nations system on one hand and the African Union and IGAD on the other, more should be done to develop common messaging and joint advocacy with those two regional actors on the different aspects of the UNMISS mandate and the implementation of the Revitalized Peace Agreement, such as the Mission's freedom of movement and humanitarian access. Furthermore, the normative and policy framework that the African Union has developed over the past two decades on issues of governance, human rights and elections can help to overcome challenges related to the political will and the capacity of South Sudanese actors and institutions. Overall, the objective is to broaden engagement rather than relegate concerns to bilateral exchanges between the United Nations and South Sudan. The region and Africa as a whole will benefit tremendously from the stabilization of South Sudan. Consequently, they have an enormous stake in the success of UNMISS.   Second, existing United Nations resources in the region, namely the United Nations Office to the African Union and the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the Horn of Africa, should be utilized more effectively so as to strengthen engagement with the African Union and those of its member States that are directly involved in the peace process. Doing so will help to keep those actors fully informed of the Mission's efforts and facilitate the mobilization of their support as necessary. Similarly, resources at United Nations Headquarters should be leveraged to their fullest.","['Drought', 'Epidemic', 'Flood', 'Other']","['Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding', 'Protection and Human Rights']",['South Sudan'],UN Document

With 27 million people in need of humanitarian assistance - including 15.8 million children, the scale and complexity of needs and protection concerns remain overwhelming.      - Close to 680,000 people received life-saving emergency assistance through UNICEF's rapid response mechanism and the cholera rapid response; over 540,000 people were provided with safe access to water, sanitation and hygiene; 153,000 children under 5 were treated for severe acute malnutrition; and almost 35,000 vulnerable children benefited from psychosocial support.       - However, with a 81% funding gap, UNICEF humanitarian response remains largely underfunded. Without timely and adequate funding, the multifaceted needs of the Congolese children will continue to worsen.  **SITUATION IN NUMBERS**       - **27,000,000**  People in need of humanitarian assistance     - **15,800,000**  Children in need of humanitarian assistance      - **4,860,000**  IDPs 3 7,638  cases of cholera since January    - **7,638**  cases of cholera since January  **SITUATION OVERVIEW AND HUMANITARIAN NEEDS**      With 27 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, including 15.8 million children, the scale and complexity of the humanitarian needs and protection concerns remain overwhelming, compounded by limited basic services and poor infrastructure.      During the first semester 2022, following intensified conflicts and violence in the eastern provinces of the country, the humanitarian situation has continued to deteriorate. Over 800,000 people have been displaced between January and June and at least one in three internally displaced people (IDP) live in Ituri province where a growing number of targeted attacks against civilian populations and infrastructure including IDP camps, schools or health facilities were reported. Increased military operations in North Kivu and Ituri provinces have further placed children at risk and the two provinces reported the highest number of verified grave violations against children. Overall, almost 2,000 grave violations against children were verified through the UN Monitoring and Reporting Mechanism (MRM) during the first semester - 25% of cases being recruitment and use. As such, a 92% increase of children verified as being associated with armed groups has been reported for the first three months of 2022 compared to the last quarter 2021. This highly volatile security situation, including threats and attacks against humanitarian workers has also hampered the access to crisis-affected children to provide a timely response.       Furthermore, DRC has continued to battle against outbreaks and epidemics. 75,000 suspected measles cases and 1,048 deaths have already been reported between January and June largely exceeding the total number of notified cases in 2021 (55,771 - 35% increase at mid-year). The number of cholera cases has also increased by 53% compared to the same period last year with 7,638 suspected cholera cases and 114 deaths reported by the epidemiologic week 26 (1.9% case fatality). The most affected provinces are South Kivu (35% of suspected cases), Haut-Lomami (21% suspected cases and 45% of deaths), North-Kivu (20% of suspected cases), Tanganyika (19% of suspected cases and 21% of deaths). The country also experienced a new Ebola virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in Mbandaka that was declared in April. It is the third outbreak in the Equateur province since 2018 and the 14th outbreak in DRC. Four cases were confirmed and one probable case, all of whom died.   Finally, the nutrition situation continues to be critical in the DRC. As of June 2022, the number of nutritional alerts increased by 45% compared to the same period last year. 19% of the total health zones in the country are on nutritional alerts with the Equateur and Maniema provinces being the most affected.",['Epidemic'],"['Contributions', 'Coordination', 'Education', 'Food and Nutrition', 'Health', 'Protection and Human Rights', 'Shelter and Non-Food Items', 'Water Sanitation Hygiene']",['Democratic Republic of the Congo'],Situation Report

3899270,"**Iraq: Drought crisis destroys income and crops countrywide**  Farming communities in Iraq have seen their wheat, vegetable, and fruit harvests decline for the second year in a row because of severe drought conditions. Households throughout the country will be increasingly vulnerable to eroded incomes and challenges accessing sufficient food, warns the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) in a new survey ahead of the UN climate change conference (COP 27) in Egypt next month.  A quarter of the 1,341 households [surveyed]( ) by NRC across five governorates this year said they witnessed over 90 per cent of wheat failure this season, a direct result of water shortages according to those interviewed.  A further 25 per cent said they had made no net profit out of their wheat crop for the entire year. Prolonged drought spells have forced one-quarter of farming families to rely on food assistance amid a lack of harvest.  'We are seeing the continued damage from Iraq's climate and water crisis,' said NRC's Iraq Country Director James Munn. 'People are witnessing their fertile land and crops vanish year after year. The lands that have fed a nation are drying up fast.'  A worsening climate and water crisis spells disaster for regions that have long relied on agriculture as the principal source of income and livelihoods. Should the current drought conditions continue to damage crops and harvests, Iraq's farming communities will be forced from their lands to urban areas in search of alternative sources of income.  For the second consecutive year, NRC has [documented]( ) the impact of Iraq's water and climate crisis on farmers and displacement-affected populations. The new report shows that one in three families in drought hotspots had to reduce the area of land that they plant, resulting in significant loss of crops and incomes. Four out of 10 said they have harvested less wheat, barley, fruit, and vegetables this year than they did last year.  Iraq's drought crisis has worsened over recent years due to record low rainfall and rising temperatures due to climate change. These conditions are compounded by reduced river flow from Iraq's neighbouring countries, as well as a lack of investment and water management nationally, resulting in worsened water quality and quantity.  NRC interviewed people who said they or their relatives had to leave their land altogether as a result of the situation. More than a third of respondents (38 per cent) reported an increase in social tensions over competition for resources and jobs.  'We must recognise that lives and livelihoods are being harmed every day by the climate and water crisis, and this requires ramped up national and international efforts,' added Munn.   Up to 4 per cent of those surveyed have been forced to move elsewhere as drought conditions get worse. Tayseer, 42, said he is considering leaving his land in Hawija, northern Iraq, as he expects a damaging income loss.  He told NRC, 'I used to make IQD 10,000,000 ($6,800 USD) each season. This year I may not even get 2,000,000 ($1,400 USD) because I could only plant half of my land and will only get half of the produce that I used to get.  'If drought continues, I have to find another job. I have to leave the land. If I can't plant it, who is going to be able to do so? Almost 10 families here have left their land… they couldn't dig new wells or get electricity,' Tayseer added.

1563146,"Two people are reported dead following flooding in Sagaing Region yesterday as incessant rain battered Katha, Wuntho and Kawlin townships.  In Katha, creeks swelled and flooded nearby villages, causing landslides that killed two people, according to the township's Information and Public Relations Department.  In Wuntho, floods destroyed crops and killed farm animals across the township, damaging bridges and disrupting the area's transportation system. Local officials coordinated rescue operations in concert with civil society organisations.  Kawlin Township also experienced severe flooding, which affected 4,000 homes.  'The water levels reached four feet in a matter of 30 minutes, but the floods subsided quickly,' said Ko Maung Maung, a resident of Kawlin.  Local officials said the rainfall reached six inches in Kawlin and 10.37 inches in Wuntho. The extent of the damage remains unknown. Sagaing Region Chief Minister Dr Myint Hlaing visited the area to help with rescue operations, a resident said, blaming the disaster on the reckless disposal of soil from gold mining.  The chief minister pledged full cooperation by members of parliament and departmental officials with rescue workers in addressing the effects of environmental degradation in the region.  The regional government contributed K20 million and emergency relief to victims of the disaster and urged officials to help with recovery and resettlement.  The region was the worst-hit by severe flooding in August 2015, suffering numerous losses of life and damage to property.

1772576,"On November 8, 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, the strongest storm ever to make landfall, swept through 9 regions of the Philippines, including the city of Tacloban, which is home to 242,000 inhabitants, and Leyte. Up to 11.3 million people were affected by the typhoon, damaging nearly 1.1 million homes and structures across the country.  ACTED's response was rapid. ACTED was reactive on the ground, only 2 days post-typhoon, with 3 bases in northern Leyte and Eastern Samar. ACTED was one of the first NGOs in Guiuan, where the typhoon first made landfall, meeting the immediate basic needs of those affected by the disaster.  ACTED teams were fully mobilised from the outset to support those households most affected by the disaster. At this stage, three years on, ACTED has moved from the emergency stage to a longer-term development strategy, to promote inclusive and sustainable growth, with a focus on community led recovery and development.  **ACTED's response overview**  November 8th 2013: Typhoon Haiyan hits the Philippines.  November 9th 2013: Evaluation of the needs and emergency response begins.  Activities of 2013/2014 to support communities in need:  '  Distribution of emergency food rations to 323,366 people;  '  Distribution of 43,880 hygiene kits and 82,530 water kits;  '  Distribution of non-food items, such as blankets, to over 25,500 households;  '  Distribution of 17,167 shelter repair kits and 9,901 tarpaulins;  '  7,000 Metric Tonnes of debris and medical waste cleared from 12 hospitals;  '  Construction of 300 temporary shelters in North Leyte;  '  Cash for assets activities benefiting 9,553 households.  **In 2015**: ACTED transitioned from early recovery activities to longer-term development programs, through the implementation of a comprehensive program to improve the WASH status in 64 barangays (over 50,000 people), a program to reinforce sustainable livelihoods of 6,000 farming households affected by the typhoon and create linkages with local markets, and another program to support 126 families living in unsafe areas with a new house in a safe location.  **In 2016**: ACTED continues to focus its activities on longer-term development by supporting and strengthening local communities, in order to promote sustainability and resilience against future natural disasters.  **Sustainable solutions for the future**  Three years after Typhoon Haiyan made landfall in the Philippines, significant achievements have been made in eastern Visayas. Eastern Visayas is one of the poorest regions in the Philippines and also is the most disaster-prone area of the country. Families that live in the hardest hit areas are particularly vulnerable and in need of sustainable solutions, which adequately reflect their protection, livelihoods, shelter and water, sanitation and hygiene needs while building their resilience.  ACTED's work adopts a resilience approach using the disaster risk management cycle to guide its programming and provide the crucial link between emergency response, early recovery, and longer term development. ACTED aims to build the resilience of communities to support a sustainable reduction in vulnerability to disaster impact. Moving forward, ACTED is focusing on supporting shelter reconstruction that incorporates 'build back safer' techniques to increase communities' resilience to future disasters; improve community water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) access working closely with both the local government and the community; and support the restoration of livelihoods by training farmers and facilitating linkages to markets to boost farmer households incomes.","['Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Storm Surge', 'Tropical Cyclone']","['Disaster Management', 'Recovery and Reconstruction', 'Shelter and Non-Food Items', 'Water Sanitation Hygiene']",['Philippines'],News and Press Release
3710739,"**Beirut, Lebanon, February 4, 2021 '** Six months after the explosion at the Beirut port, Lebanon continues to face multiple and acute crises, with over half the population living below the poverty line and without a stable source of income. No meaningful recovery can be achieved without involving women and local civil society in finding a solution for the country's compounding crises.  Bujar Hoxha, CARE Lebanon country director says, ""It was encouraging to see many women, girls and youth leading in the streets, trying to clean the city in the first day after the explosion. It was heart-warming for many of us in the humanitarian world to see local communities showing leadership when the entire city was still in complete shock. They played a key role in the first few days and hours and it is crucial they still be allowed to do so on this long path to recovery.""  The blast, which occurred back in August 4, 2020, left 207 dead and more than 6,500 injured while more than 300,000 people were displaced from their homes. It caused between US $3.8 billion and $4.6 billion in physical damage. In addition to the damage caused to homes, hospitals, schools, and streets, the blast forced many businesses to close, contributing to a loss of economic activity estimated at between $2.9 billion and $3.5 billion, according to the World Bank.  According to Hoxha, ""Today thousands of people have been able to return to their homes, in particular thanks to the help of local and international NGOs, but others, who are still living with relatives or who have moved out of the city after the blast, are still waiting for financial support that will help them return homes. Entire neighborhoods of the city remain destroyed and many businesses have been unable to reopen.""  ""We appreciate and recognize the great solidarity from the international community following the Beirut explosion. However, a lot more still needs to happen in order for many families to avoid sleeping with empty stomachs, and to provide them with even basic health care and medicines. Today many Lebanese have difficulties in securing enough food to feed their families, and for that more systematic support is needed from the international community,"" he adds.  Since October 2019, the national currency, the Lebanese Lira, has plummeted against the USD. From 1,500 Lira for every one dollar in summer 2019, it is now around 9,000 per one USD; plunging half the Lebanese population into poverty. A CARE survey at the end of 2020 found that being able to provide food for their family and finding stable work were the main worries of the majority of Lebanese.  32-year-old mother Rebecca says, ""Before the crisis, I accumulated jobs to raise the children. Today I am almost unemployed... Everything has gone up in the supermarket, I can hardly buy anything anymore, neither meat, nor chicken, nor butter, nor cheese. I try to make everything at home, even cocoa spread to replace Nutella, but even with all of these savings it's very difficult for me to make ends meet.""  So far, CARE International has provided direct and indirect aid to 43,000 people throughout Lebanon through projects relating to food security, protection, shelter, gender and livelihoods and with a focus on women and girls, especially those living as refugees who tend to be the hardest hit when disaster strikes.  Yara Assi, gender and protection coordinator at CARE Lebanon says, ""The Lebanese have shown remarkable resilience throughout the aftermath of the Beirut explosion, which deserves respect, not pity. We want to establish equity between all society members. This is impossible without empowering woman and girls and changing the roles and the relations in the community, giving space to every vulnerable member of society to speak up. We are working so that the change will come from within the community, knowing that some of the people we work with come from very conservative backgrounds within a patriarchal society.""

1656881,"**10th anniversary of the 'Probo Koala incident' - Friday 19 August 2016**  GENEVA (17 August 2016) ' Speaking ahead of the 10th anniversary of the illegal dumping of toxic waste in Côte d'Ivoire, a group of United Nations experts\* urge the Ivorian Government, all responsible States and the international community to take this opportunity to address the ongoing human rights impacts of the incident.  The UN human rights experts also call on Trafigura, the company behind the 'Probo Koala incident', to support this process by disclosing all the information it has about the contents and nature of the waste dumped in Côte d'Ivoire, and its likely ongoing health and environmental consequences.  'On 19 August 2006, the cargo ship 'Probo Koala' discharged 500 tonnes or the equivalent of over twelve 20 shipping containers of toxic waste in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. The hazardous substances, which belonged to the Anglo-Dutch commodity trading company Trafigura, were later dumped at 18 sites around the city while many other possible locations remain unknown to date. A month earlier, Trafigura decided not to dispose of the toxic waste in the Netherlands because proper disposal costs more.  According to official estimates, 15 people died, 69 people were hospitalized and over 108,000 others sought medical treatment after the so called 'Probo Koala incident'.  Ten years on, victims of the dumping and other residents in Abidjan remain in the dark about the ongoing dangers to their health. Residents still complain of the smell from the waste when it rains heavily, as well as headaches, skin problems and respiratory issues that they believe are linked to the incident. Many victims have not received an adequate remedy for the harms caused by the incident and report that they are have not been able to afford medical treatment notably after October 2006 when the relevant free medical treatment finished.  They still do not even know what was in the toxic waste; whether the dumpsites have been adequately cleaned-up, and whether the waste has entered the water supply or the food chain. Recognizing the lasting adverse impacts that hazardous materials can have on water and soils, there is real concern for food safety and the health of future generations.   The Government of Côte d'Ivoire must seize the opportunity of the 10th anniversary to address the long-term health and environmental impacts of the incident and seek additional financial and technical assistance from public health experts and the wider international community.  In a post-conflict country such as the Côte d'Ivoire, it is even more vital for the international community to provide support for this work. Given their role in these events, the governments of the Netherlands and the United Kingdom where Trafigura is registered, have a particular responsibility to do so.  Many victims also report that they have still not received compensation. It is estimated that only 63% of registered victims received compensation under a February 2007 settlement agreement between Trafigura and the Ivorian Government. Victims' associations appear not to have been consulted before the agreement was signed.  Although another 30,000 victims were due to receive compensation following the settlement in September 2009 of a civil claim against Trafigura in the UK, funds destined for over 6,000 of those victims were reportedly misappropriated by a fraudulent group who claimed to represent the victims in Côte d'Ivoire. Those responsible for the funds' misappropriation were sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment on 13 January 2015, confirmed by the Court of Appeal in Abidjan on 27 July 2016.  However, none of them have been arrested and no warrant has been issued for them. We urge the Government of Cote d'Ivoire to execute this sentence soonest. As underlined in the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, access to an effective remedy is critical to address business-related harm.  Also, in March 2015, the United Kingdom refused to launch a criminal investigation into whether Trafigura's London-based subsidiary had conspired in the UK to dump the waste in Abidjan.  This lack of action and information has left those affected by the dumping feeling abandoned and vulnerable to further victimization. Some have joined the many associations that have been established in Abidjan to claim additional compensation from Trafigura. These associations have brought new legal actions against the trading company in the Netherlands and Abidjan.  We are concerned that some victims' associations have allegedly taken advantage of this situation by making dubious promises of compensation in return for upfront fees from victims and a share of any damages that they are awarded. The government must take steps to regulate these associations and ensure that people do not become victims twice over ' of both the dumping and unscrupulous actors.  In November 2015, the Côte d'Ivoire government announced that it had completed the decontamination of all of the dumpsites. At the request of the Côte d'Ivoire Government, the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) performed an environmental audit of the dumpsites in July 2016 to verify their decontamination. UNEP is due to publish its results and recommendations at the end of the year. The government has also recently initiated a process to check the health of victims in one of the villages most affected by the dumping.  We welcome these steps and urge Côte d'Ivoire to communicate widely the results of UNEP's findings, to affected communities in particular. We also urge the Ivorian authorities and the international community to take effective measures to protect the right to health and the right to a healthy environment of all victims and their families, including through free medical treatment for long-term health consequences and preventative measures for environmental threats.  We urge Trafigura to facilitate this process by disclosing all information it has about the contents and nature of the waste and its likely health and environmental impacts.'

3724300,"**By:** Minaz Kerawala, Communications and Public Relations Advisor  At about 3:30 p.m. local time on Monday, March 22, 2021, a fire broke out it the Balukhali section of the Kutupalong Rohingya refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. Feeding on the densely packed bamboo-and-tarpaulin shelters of the world's largest refugee camp, the blaze spread quickly and was not contained until nearly midnight.  Our partner, Caritas Bangladesh, swung into action right away. In a video recorded on the site at noon on March 23, Inmanuel Chayan Biswas, head of operation for Caritas Bangladesh's local emergency response program, reported, 'More than 5,000 houses and shelters have burned away. Many have lost their life's belongings. Now, they are struggling to have food to eat.'  Assessments conducted since that video was recorded indicate that at least 15 people have died and some 400 are missing. The shelters of over 17,000 households have been destroyed. Most of the nearly 88,000 affected people have moved to neighbouring sections of the camp to seek shelter with relatives. Biswas fears the resultant overcrowding could cause a spike in COVID-19 cases, which were already trending upward.  **Stepping up to help**  Caritas Bangladesh has constituted three emergency response teams to conduct a detailed needs assessment and to provide emergency assistance. These teams are also coordinating with other aid agencies and government officials.  Contingency stocks of relief supplies are being readied and work is underway to register affected families so that food, non-food items and emergency shelter kits can be distributed efficiently. Given its expertise in shelter rehabilitation, Caritas Bangladesh now anticipates contributing mainly to the joint civil society reconstruction effort.  'I am sharing this message all the way from the Rohingya camp in Bangladesh, asking \[for\] your support for this critical response,' Biswas said, highlighting the additional need for resources that this latest crisis in the lives of a long-suffering people has created.  It is hoped that this fire, the second in three months, will draw attention to the issue of the sustainability of the camps and the complexities of the Rohingya refugee crisis.","['Epidemic', 'Technological Disaster']","['Food and Nutrition', 'Protection and Human Rights', 'Shelter and Non-Food Items']","['Bangladesh', 'Myanmar']",News and Press Release

Countries already reeling from increased poverty, hunger, and malnutrition as a result of COVID-19, climate shocks, and protracted conflict now face further suffering from Putin's unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine. The United States is urgently responding to this global crisis to meet growing needs to avert a catastrophe right now and build stronger, more resilient food systems to prevent the next crisis.   **SITUATION AT A GLANCE**  -  Experts estimate that the number of people living in extreme poverty could increase by as many as 75 to 95 million people in 2022.      - As many as 828 million people go to bed hungry every night, the number of those facing acute food insecurity has soared from 135 million to 345 million since 2019. A total of 50 million people in 45 countries are teetering on the edge of famine. (World Food Programme). Women and girls are disproportionately impacted, particularly in low-and middle-income countries. (CARE).      - The Horn of Africa is facing the most severe food security crisis in the world right now; the region has experienced a record-setting drought with four consecutive poor rainy seasons. The UN reports that approximately 21 million people across Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya required emergency food assistance as of September 2022 and that number will increase if the region experiences an unprecedented fifth failed rainy season as projected in the coming months (Food Security and Nutrition Working Group).      - The UN Secretary General has said multiple famines may be declared this year and projects 2023 may be even worse. Famine is declared when catastrophic hunger becomes widespread. Up to 50 million people in 45 countries are right on the edge of famine including in the Buur Hakaba and Baidoa districts of southern Somalia where famine is likely to occur from October-December 2022 in the absence of significant humanitarian assistance reaching people most in need.   The historic drought in the Horn of Africa and the Sahel, persistent ongoing humanitarian crises, and the added impacts of global food insecurity created by Russia's invasion of Ukraine are rapidly increasing the number of children suffering from wasting. In 2020, 45.4 million young children were affected by wasting, of whom 13.6 million were severely wasted. UNICEF estimates that the global food crisis will push an additional 260,000 children into severe wasting in the 15 most affected countries. Since the start of Putin's war in Ukraine, the USAID has committed $10.65 billion to respond to the global food security crisis, including nearly $8.4 billion in immediate humanitarian assistance to address food insecurity, including through direct food assistance and vital complementary assistance like safe drinking water, health care, and protection for the most vulnerable.      - USAID and its partners continue to scale up humanitarian assistance for drought response in the Horn of Africa by more than doubling funding commitments from nearly $806 million in FY 2021 to more than $1.8 billion in FY 2022.   USAID has supported the procurement and transport of more than 60,000 metric tons of Ukrainian grain for use in emergency food assistance programming in Ethiopia and Yemen. USAID's continued partnership with the UN World Food Programme is supporting the additional procurement, movement, and storage of up to 150,000 metric tons of Ukrainian grain to address acute food insecurity around the globe.      - In response to the rising global food insecurity, USAID and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) took the extraordinary step in April to draw down the full balance of $282 million from the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust (BEHT). With these funds, USAID procured U.S. food commodities to bolster existing emergency food operations in six countries already facing severe food insecurity: Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, and Yemen.      - Through Feed the Future, the U.S. government's initiative to combat global hunger, addresses the root causes of poverty, hunger, and malnutrition in more than 35 countries, the United States will invest $5 billion over five years for global food security and nutrition. This will include $1 billion in private sector-led projects that strengthen local and regional food systems. President Biden recently announced that the United States is expanding Feed the Future to eight new countries, including those vulnerable to the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.      - In addition to providing increased support for wasting treatment at the individual country level, USAID is also providing an unprecedented $200 million to UNICEF to procure and deliver lifesaving Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food to children facing severe malnutrition in the most impacted countries. USAID's significant support has mobilized other philanthropic donors to match our commitments, crowding in an additional $280 million in funding to mitigate severe child malnutrition.      - USAID is working with partners, such as multilateral banks and the private sector, to improve farmers' ability to obtain and afford agricultural inputs to help farmers use fertilizer more efficiently and small and medium businesses to develop local sources of fertilizer.      - USAID launched the Agriculture Resilience Initiative (AGRI) -Ukraine to bolster Ukrainian agricultural production and exports in order to alleviate local and global food insecurity. Funding for the AGRI-Ukraine initiative supports: Purchase and delivery of critical inputs for farmers; improvements in export logistics and infrastructure; increases in farmers' access to financing to enable a full crop harvest; and drying, storage, and processing support for micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises in the agriculture sector.",['Drought'],"['Agriculture', 'Contributions', 'Food and Nutrition', 'Health', 'Protection and Human Rights', 'Water Sanitation Hygiene']","['Ethiopia', 'Kenya', 'Somalia', 'Ukraine', 'United States of America', 'World', 'Yemen']",News and Press Release

The conflict has intensified during recent fighting seasons, increasing civilian casualties and displacement in the country.  In addition, the deterioration of the refugee hosting environment in Pakistan has resulted in a surge of Afghan returnees who require humanitarian assistance.  Together, the increase in conflict-induced internal displacement and the surge in returns have strained the response capacity of local communities, humanitarian agencies, and the Government of Afghanistan (GoA).  The UN projects that approximately 1 million people will remain internally displaced in 2017, including  300,000'400,000 conflict-displaced persons and 600,000 returnees.   - During the first three months of 2017, humanitarian staff were involved or targeted in  92 security-related events, resulting in the deaths of seven aid workers and injuries to four, the UN reports.

The shipments contained **5.8 million defined daily doses of medication**, including N-95 masks, antibiotics, Covid-19 therapies, diabetes medication, and cancer treatments.  **PREPPING FOR FIRE SEASON**  In recent days, **a retrofitted Blackhawk aircraft supported by Direct Relief** has been used multiple times for firefighting in recent weeks.  Santa Barbara County's Fire Department now has access to a helicopter capable of 1,000-gallon water drops to support firefighting efforts, and the HH-60L 'Firehawk' helicopter 964 is responding to local fires and also available regional support as part of the mutual aid system.  Direct Relief contributed $400,000 directly to the Firehawk's retrofit, and $750,000 was raised by other donors through Direct Relief. The military-grade aircraft was formerly in service with the California Air National Guard as an air ambulance and has since been upgraded with state-of-the-art avionics, new rescue hoist and water tank.  The aircraft has increased stability in high winds and night-flying equipment, critical assets during fire season.  **UKRAINE RESPONSE TO DATE**  **Since February 24, Direct Relief has provided medical aid weighing more than 400 tons in weight and including over 68 million defined doses of medication, with more on the way.**  Maintaining therapy for chronic diseases is important to prevent additional waves of medical emergencies that further strain an already taxed health system. This includes care for diabetes, cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and others like cancer and rare diseases.  To support chronic disease care and cancer treatment in Ukraine and the surrounding countries, Direct Relief has collaborated with groups including the Ministries of Health in Ukraine and Moldova, and the World Health Organization to provide **60,000 vials of chemotherapy, 320,000 bottles of cardiovascular medications, and 61,000 vials/pens of insulin, with an additional 1.8 million vials to come.**  Direct Relief is also preparing to send **200,000 doses of Covid-19 therapy** to Ukraine and the surrounding countries. Ukraine's Ministry of Health posted this week about receiving an additional infusion of support from Direct Relief, including antibiotics and other requested medications.  **EMERGENCY RESPONSE**  Propelled by fierce winds and defying the efforts of more than 1,800 firefighters and other responders, the Calf Canyon/Hermit's Peak Fire has grown to more than 270,000 acres in New Mexico, according to the governmental National Wildfire Coordinating Group.  Last week, Direct Relief delivered an emergency delivery of air purifiers, N95 masks, and personal care products requested by Tewa Women United, a Native women-led organization that has also received a Direct Relief Fund for Health Equity grant. In addition, the organization made initial contact with New Mexico Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster and with the Federal Emergency Management Agency on the ground in New Mexico. The medical aid was distributed to the community this week.  Additionally, Direct Relief shipped emergency medical supplies to Old Havana, Cuba, in response to a deadly hotel explosion that killed an estimated 43 people on Tuesday.

Giving a progress report on interventions and recovery measures, Dube-Ncube said the province is on course to ensure the full restoration of water supply to the greater Othongathi by November 2022.   'Repairs are underway on sewer networks and sewer pump stations. It is intended that most of these repairs will be completed by the end of November 2022.  'The reconstruction of roads and infrastructure, especially in the Southern Basin which became a scene of major destruction following the collapse of the Shongweni Dam, is well underway. The damage in this part of the province impacted negatively on the economy and affected companies such as Toyota and Transnet,' Dube-Ncube said.  However, Dube-Ncube acknowledged that while services that were disrupted have been restored in many areas, the province is still faced with the challenge of building back better, especially where infrastructure was completely washed away.   R406m allocated to affected municipalities  On disaster funding, the Premier reported that the Department of Cooperative Governance, through the National Disaster Management Centre, coordinated the submission of funding requests for emergency relief measures from organs of State which incurred damages due to flooding.  To date, she said R406.8 million has been received by the affected municipalities to perform various works.  'The eThekwini grant of R185 087 026 has been approved and was transferred to the metro on 7 September 2022,' Dube-Ncube said.  **Flood relief donor account gets over R7m**  The Premier also announced that as at 2 September, R7 650 279.58 had been donated through a dedicated bank account, an increase of R3 412 000.00 from R4 235 603.24.  The Provincial Flood Disaster account number 4103831039 was opened with ABSA by KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Government towards the rebuilding process.  'We thank all those who have been able to come to the aid of those affected by the disaster.  As determined by the donors, some of this money will go towards the Department of Education and Health, while the remaining will be shared between the Departments of Social Development and Human Settlements,"" said Dube-Ncube.  **Unidentified bodies**  Meanwhile, Dube-Ncube reported that at least 27 bodies, which were discovered after the floods, have still not been identified.  'Of these, 12 profiles were generated but not identified. So far, five cases have been positively linked with families, while two cases have returned a negative result, and will have to be reconducted,' she said.   The Premier said the provincial government understands the frustration of the families over the pace og the DNA service, and they are doing their best to get this completed to enable families to find closure.

The creation of these response plans was put together by the members of the Community Disaster and Climate Change Committees (CDCCC) formed as part of the Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction (MDRR) Project in Vanuatu, which is currently implemented by the Vanuatu Meteorology and Geo-hazards Department (VMGD) in partnership with the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) on behalf of the Vanuatu Government.  There are 21 CDCCCs for Port Vila Municipality Ward Councils and 28 CDCCC created within the South Efate Area Councils, which covers Eratap, Erakor, Pango, Ifira, Tanvasoko and Mele Area Councils under Shefa Province. Over one hundred CDCCC members attended a training workshop last week in Port Vila aimed at building their capacity by knowing their roles and responsibilities as CDCCC members within their own communities.  The main outcomes of the training are that CDCCC members developed their Wards and Area Councils Tsunami response plans, understanding on their roles and responsibilities as CDCCC members, have a better understanding of NDMO's response structure and understand the tsunami early warning system and how it works.  The tsunami response plan is basically an evacuation plan that will assist communities to respond better to any future warnings. The response plans highlighted the various roles and responsibilities of different groups like Chiefs, Churches, Women, Youth, teachers, health workers and those vulnerable groups within our communities before, during and after a tsunami disaster event.  The response plans is targeted to include the various responsibilities of the Port Vila Municipal Council and Shefa Province at the top level, then to the Ward and Area Councils level and the Community level (CDCCC) on how best all levels can prepare, response and recover effectively to the tsunami hazard.  For the benefit of the Mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction Project, the tsunami response plans will show all tsunami evacuation signs; danger zones, safe location, right and left evacuation routes and tsunami information boards. These signs will soon be installed within Port Vila and its surrounding peri-urban areas. Each Ward or Area Council Tsunami Response Plan will have the total number of all different evacuation signs, tsunami information boards and their locations. How many of these signs to be installed in each of the communities within Port Vila and South Efate areas are mentioned in the response plans. The Port Vila Municipality and South Efate Tsunami response plans will have all CDCCC boundaries and total of all evacuation signs and information boards.  When the tsunami response plans completed, community members are encouraged to work closely with their community leaders and CDCCC members to know their plans and their roles as members of their own communities to ensure all are tsunami ready in future.  As one of the most vulnerable countries to natural hazards like tsunami on earth, Vanuatu needs to prepare and be equipped with the right knowledge and information about tsunami warnings and how to response better.

3717419,"**Executive summary**  As the UK deals with a new strain of Covid-19 and attention here is rightly focused on the domestic disaster, we must not forget the world's most fragile states where the pandemic is magnifying existing health and socio-economic challenges with devastating effects.  These places, beset by years of conflict, violence and natural disasters such as drought and flooding, have left millions of displaced and other vulnerable people with poor access to adequate healthcare, water, food and ways to earn an income.  The Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), which brings together 14 leading UK aid charities to raise funds for countries without the capacity to respond in the face of a large-scale humanitarian disaster, launched its Coronavirus Appeal in July 2020 when it became clear that Covid-19 was going to be devastating for the world's poorest communities.  This report examines the impact of Covid-19 so far and what the year ahead holds for the world's most fragile states ' Yemen and Syria in the Middle East; Somalia, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in Africa; Afghanistan in Asia ' and the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh.  Evidence comes from DEC-commissioned independent Response Reviews in these seven places, interviews with country directors and senior staff from the 14 DEC charities as well as UN representatives in these fragile states, and a survey of senior staff at DEC charities on the ground and their local partners.  The central findings of the survey are alarming. Almost all (98%) agreed that the pandemic had worsened the humanitarian crisis in their respective countries, with three quarters (73%) saying it is the worst it has been in the last 10 years.  Covid-19 cases and deaths are substantially underreported due to lack of data, stigma and fear.  It is easy to underestimate levels of coronavirus in these fragile states. Covid-19 cases and deaths are substantially underreported due to lack of data, stigma and fear to the extent that the true picture is not known. Nonetheless, already fragile health services are being disrupted and overwhelmed, despite the fact that many people are too scared to go to health centres or hospitals for fear of catching the disease, or stigma of being thought infected. Others are reluctant to attend in case they are caught up in violence on the way.  The economic impact of the virus is, however, undeniable. The pandemic has led to worsening inflation, higher prices, less trade and therefore fewer jobs and ways of earning an income, particularly for those in informal, daily paid work or who rely on remittances from family abroad.  Many people in these countries have no resources to fall back on and no economic safety net provided by the state. Lower income means less food. In the DEC member survey, 96% said the economic impact of Covid-19 had affected people's ability to buy food and other essentials.  As a result, increasing numbers of people are going hungry, reducing the number of meals they eat a day and, in the worst-hit places, the spectre of famine looms. Parts of South Sudan and Yemen are on the brink of such a catastrophe, while Afghanistan and DRC are at risk. In the DEC member survey, 83% agreed or strongly agreed that, without increased funding, thousands are likely to die from hunger in 2021.  Meanwhile, people in many fragile states have to deal with continuing conflict which often seems to them an even bigger problem than coronavirus, and something more likely to kill them. Together, though, conflict and Covid-19 are a fatal combination. Conflict causes huge displacement of people. For example, more than a million were displaced in northwest Syria alone in the three months before the pandemic hit. The impact of the virus on displaced people, commonly living in makeshift tents and shelters, has been particularly severe because it's more difficult for them to find jobs and access healthcare.  Worryingly, aid funding is reducing just at the time that humanitarian needs are rising. The UN predicted in December that a record 235 million people globally will need humanitarian assistance and protection in 2021, a near 40% increase on 2020. This is almost entirely due to Covid-19, it said, but humanitarian aid budgets face dire shortfalls as a result. Country directors of DEC members fear having to re-prioritise which life-saving programmes should be funded and which of the most vulnerable people should receive humanitarian relief.  The vaccine rollout offers hope, with the Covax facility ensuring that even the poorest countries will receive immunisations for health workers and the most vulnerable people, but it is not a panacea. Delivery will be challenging in areas with little infrastructure and where there is conflict, and will unlikely make a marked difference this year to the immense challenges faced by the world's most fragile states.  In the meantime, DEC charities will continue to help provide vital support such as health services to care for people who become ill from the virus, routine vaccination programmes, and mother and baby clinics. They will ensure water and sanitation systems are maintained so that disease outbreaks can be prevented. Displaced people reliant on food aid will be supported too and other vulnerable people will receive vouchers or cash grants to buy food.  In the first three months of the first phase (July 2020 to January 2021) of the DEC-funded humanitarian response to the pandemic, donations to the DEC appeal were primarily spent on health projects (26%), including isolation and treatment centres, supporting fragile health systems and providing PPE to frontline medics. There was also a focus on water, sanitation and hygiene activities (25%), such as providing clean water, handwashing stations and hygiene kits. Other priorities included supporting livelihoods (18%) and providing food (8%).  Funding is making a significant difference: in the DEC member survey, 88% agreed or strongly agreed that humanitarian action had helped prevent the spread of Covid-19 in their country. But in the coming year, as funding reduces and needs increase, there will be hard choices to be made about which basic human needs should take priority.  In the next phase of the DEC-funded response, in the face of unprecedented levels of need and the threat of famine, a top priority will be to reduce hunger levels with food aid such as supplies of beans and rice, vouchers to buy food and cash grants which also help stimulate the local economy.  A continued investment in Covid-19 prevention, suppression and treatment measures ' such as equipping isolation or quarantine facilities, training frontline health workers, and delivering public health messages ' will also provide a valuable legacy, helping tackle future waves of Covid-19 as well as outbreaks of other diseases.  The generosity that the UK public, government, companies and institutions have shown through their donations to the DEC Coronavirus Appeal has been truly appreciated, given the scale of the disaster being faced at home. This report shows that unprecedented levels of need lie ahead but that funds to provide humanitarian assistance are and will continue to make a direct and practical difference to people in the world's most perilous places.  **About the DEC**  When large-scale disasters hit countries without the capacity to respond, the DEC brings together 14 leading UK aid charities to raise funds quickly and efficiently. In these times of crisis, people in life-and-death situations need our help and our mission is to save, protect and rebuild lives through effective humanitarian response.  The DEC's 14 member charities are: Action Against Hunger, ActionAid UK, Age International, British Red Cross, CAFOD, CARE International UK, Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide UK, Islamic Relief Worldwide, Oxfam GB, Plan International UK, Save the Children UK, Tearfund and World Vision UK.  **About the DEC's Coronavirus Appeal**  In July 2020, the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) launched its Coronavirus Appeal to help people living in the world's most fragile states, already affected by conflict and extreme poverty, fight the new threat brought by the pandemic.  To date, the collective fundraising campaign has raised more than £36 million from the UK public and other donors. The funds raised are being used to:  -   help give vulnerable displaced families the means to protect themselves from the virus with water, soap, handwashing stations and information; -   support frontline medical and aid workers with protective equipment, medical supplies and training so they can care for the vulnerable and sick; -   ensure that the Covid-19 crisis doesn't mean people go hungry and children become malnourished.  Appeal funds were allocated to the DEC's 14 member charities which were already working in the prioritised states:  -   Yemen and Syria in the Middle East; -   Somalia, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo in Africa; and -   Afghanistan in Asia, as well as Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.  There are 24 million internally displaced people in total in these fragile states, and an additional 850,000 Rohingya people living in the world's biggest refugee camp in Bangladesh.  Appeal funds are being used to adapt on-going programmes to fight transmission of the virus, to develop new programmes to respond to the health impact of Covid-19 as well as to help communities cope with the socio-economic impact of lockdowns and other preventative measures. A total of £36 million has been raised since the appeal launched on 14 July 2020, including £10 million from the UK Government's Aid Match scheme. This report provides examples of how, during the first three months (July - October 2020) of the DEC's planned 18-month pandemic response, our members used funds donated directly to the DEC appeal.  **How this report was compiled**  The research for this report was conducted between October 2020 and February 2021 using a range of sources including evidence from the seven Real-Time Response Reviews of each appeal country that the DEC commissioned from independent consultants Groupe URD. The purpose of these reviews is to generate real-time learning about how the first six months of the DEC-funded humanitarian response has progressed, better understand how the pandemic has affected the most vulnerable communities and make recommendations for how aid delivery can be improved in the next phase of the response starting in February 2021.  The Real-Time Response Reviews included interviews with field staff, local partners, government entities, local authorities and international aid agencies; discussions with affected populations through individual interviews with local key informants (eg village chiefs, local health responders) and focus group meetings; and direct observation of programmes activities.  Additional information was gathered through a survey of 48 country directors and senior humanitarian staff from the DEC's 14 member charities operating in the seven appeal locations, as well as 21 interviews with senior representatives from DEC members working in country in the seven appeal locations and six interviews with senior representatives of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) and World Health Organisation representatives in Afghanistan, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria and Yemen.  \*Names changed to protect identities.

Smithsonian Institution.  **Kadovar**  **Papua New Guinea**  **3.608°S, 144.588°E; summit elev. 365 m**  **All times are local (unless otherwise noted)**  Kadovar, located in the Bismark Sea offshore from the island of New Guinea about 25 km NNE from the mouth of the Sepik River, has been erupting since January 2018 with intermittent ash and gas-and-steam plumes along with weak summit thermal anomalies (BGVN 46:01). Similar activity continued during this reporting period of January through August 2021 based on information from the Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Center (VAAC) and satellite data.  Relatively low activity during this reporting period consisted of primarily weak thermal anomalies in the summit crater and small gas-and-ash emissions (figure 59). On 3 and 7 January discrete ash puffs seen in HIMAWARI-8 satellite images rose to 1.5 km altitude and drifted SW and W, respectively; both dissipated within six hours. Ash plumes on 5 and 6 January rose to 1.8 km altitude and drifted NW. Occasional ash plumes were detected during March, rising to 1.5 km altitude and drifting W, based on satellite imagery. On 15 April an ash plume that rose to 1.8 km altitude and drifted W was accompanied by a small sulfur dioxide plume, according to the TROPOMI instrument on the Sentinel-5P satellite (figure 60). On 12 and 19 June, 4 July, and 1, 19, and 27 August small ash plumes that rose to 1.2-1.5 km altitude drifted W and NW.  MIROVA (Middle InfraRed Observation of Volcanic Activity) analysis of MODIS satellite data shows weak clusters of thermal anomalies during January through March and May through August 2021 (figure 61). Stronger anomalies were detected during July through August, which was also reflected in Sentinel-2 infrared satellite imagery (figure 62).  *Geological Summary.* The 2-km-wide island of Kadovar is the emergent summit of a Bismarck Sea stratovolcano of Holocene age. It is part of the Schouten Islands, and lies off the coast of New Guinea, about 25 km N of the mouth of the Sepik River. Prior to an eruption that began in 2018, a lava dome formed the high point of the andesitic volcano, filling an arcuate landslide scarp open to the south; submarine debris-avalanche deposits occur in that direction. Thick lava flows with columnar jointing forms low cliffs along the coast. The youthful island lacks fringing or offshore reefs. A period of heightened thermal phenomena took place in 1976. An eruption began in January 2018 that included lava effusion from vents at the summit and at the E coast.  *Information Contacts:* *Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC)*, Bureau of Meteorology, Northern Territory Regional Office, PO Box 40050, Casuarina, NT 0811, Australia (URL:  ); *MIROVA (Middle InfraRed Observation of Volcanic Activity)*, a collaborative project between the Universities of Turin and Florence (Italy) supported by the Centre for Volcanic Risk of the Italian Civil Protection Department (URL:  ); *Sentinel Hub Playground* (URL:  ).",['Volcano'],,['Papua New Guinea'],News and Press Release

On this occasion, international partners and local stakeholders commended the progress but noted the lack of movement in some critical areas. They called upon the parties to accelerate efforts to reconstitute the Transitional National Legislative Assembly, finalize state and local government structures, implement transitional security arrangements, establish transitional justice mechanisms and comprehensively implement the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan.  3\. Between 20 February and 2 March, the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, issued presidential decrees appointing ministers, advisers, commissioners and chairpersons of independent commissions at the state level and delegated powers to the state governors to swear them in. These appointments fell short of the stipulation in the Revitalized Agreement that women should make up 35 per cent of the appointees.  4\. On 23 March, the then Minister for Presidential Affairs, Nhial Deng Nhial, announced that elections envisioned to take place in 2022 could not be conducted without a permanent constitution and a population census. He said that more time for preparation was required and that elections would be held in 2023. On 14 April, the Press Secretary of the President, Ateny Wek Ateny, reiterated that the Government planned to hold general elections in 2023.  5\. In Juba on 8 April, in partnership with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), other United Nations entities and the Governments of Sweden, Ireland and Kenya, the Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity launched a population estimation survey. Survey results will guide the planning for the conduct of a full population and housing census in 2022. The last population and housing census was conducted in 2008.  6\. On 10 April, the President issued a series of decrees relieving and appointing senior officials. The Minister for Presidential Affairs, Nhial Deng Nhial, was replaced by Barnaba Marial Benjamin. The Chief of Defence Forces, General Johnson Juma Okot, was replaced by the South Sudan People's Defence Forces Assistant Chief of Defence Forces for Administration and Finance, General Santino Deng Wol, who is on the sanctions list pursuant to Security Council resolution [2206 (2015)]( (2015)). The President also promoted the Director of the National Security Service, General Akol Koor Kuc, to the rank of First Lieutenant General.  7\. Between 8 and 11 May, the President dissolved the Transitional National Legislative Assembly and the Council of States and reconstituted the 400-member Transitional National Legislative Assembly as a 550-member parliament. However, the gender balance of appointments fell below the 35 per cent quota for women.  8\. On 26 March, the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs established a task force to oversee the implementation of chapter V of the Revitalized Agreement. However, the draft statute and the memorandum of understanding, critical to the operationalization of the Hybrid Court for South Sudan, are still pending signature by the Government and the African Union.  9\. From 25 to 27 May, the reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission and the Max Planck Foundation for International Peace and the Rule of Law facilitated a three-day workshop on the first permanent constitution-making process. The workshop concluded with a resolution on the establishment, roles and mandates of institutions involved in the constitutional process; civic education and public participation; and the convening of a national constitutional conference.   **Implementation of the Revitalized Agreement**   10\. On 15 March, the President requested the National Transitional Committee to report on the status of unifying the command, rank and file of the Necessary Unified Forces. On 18 March, the Chair of the National Transitional Committee, Tut Gatluak, tasked the Joint Defence Board to prepare a proposal for the unification of the Necessary Unified Forces command.  11\. On 22 March, the European Union imposed sanctions on South Sudan People's Defence Forces Major General Moses Lokujo for the abduction and execution of three Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army in Opposition (SPLM/A-IO) officers and attacking SPLM/A-IO forces at the Moroto training site in Central Equatoria.   **Peace process developments**   12\. From 8 to 12 March, the peace talks brokered by the Community of Sant'Egidio between the South Sudan Opposition Movements Alliance (SSOMA) and the Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity took place in Naivasha, Kenya. The SSOMA faction of the Real Sudan People's Liberation Movement, General Paul Malong of the South Sudan United Front/Army (SSUF/A) and the Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity signed the Declaration of Principles on 10 March. The Declaration of Principles will be the guiding framework for future talks between the parties.  13\. On 2 May, the SPLM/A-IO Chief of General Staff, General Simon Gatwech Dual, confirmed that Johnson Olony, leader of the Agwelek division of the SPLM/A-IO, promoted himself to the rank of First Lieutenant General. He dismissed allegations that Johnson Olony intended to defect to the Government or form a new rebel group. The Chief of General Staff expressed frustration with the delayed implementation of the transitional security arrangements and admitted to internal administrative challenges within the SPLM/A-IO.  14\. On 3 May, former South Sudan People's Defence Forces Major General Stephen Buay Rolnyang joined General Malong's SSUF/A. One of the longest-serving officers in the Defence Forces, Stephen Buay was accused of treason, dismissed and stripped of his rank. General Buay cited poor treatment of the Defence Forces' rank and file, corruption and tribalism as reasons for his defection.    **Regional engagements and developments**  15\. On 27 February, the President attended the twenty-first Ordinary Summit of Heads of States of the East African Community, held virtually, where he recommended a regional visa waiver programme, appealed for capacity support (especially with regard to facilitating the admission of the National Revenue Authority of South Sudan to the Customs Union of the East African Community) and requested a formula that would enable South Sudan to pay its existing debt in instalments.  16\. In Juba, on 28 March, President Kiir witnessed the signing of the Declaration of Principles between the Transitional Government of the Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North. President Kiir promised to continue efforts to include the Sudan Liberation Movement/Abdul Wahid al-Nur in the Sudan peace talks. Another round of talks resumed in Juba on 26 May.    **Other major national developments**   17\. On 19 February, a section of the Jieng Council of Elders issued a statement stating that the Revitalized Agreement had failed to address the causes of insecurity in the country owing to a failure in leadership. The Council called for the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the National Dialogue Conference, including expedited elections.  18\. On 10 May, the National Dialogue Steering Committee presented to the President the final resolutions and the communiqué of the National Dialogue Conference. The President pledged to carefully consider the recommendations and implement the resolutions. Thereafter, he issued a decree dissolving the Committee.    **Economic situation**   19\. The Government has stepped up economic reforms to address public financial management, improve transparency and enhance the mobilization of non-oil revenue.   In March, the International Monetary Fund approved a second Rapid Credit Facility loan of $174.2 million to alleviate the stress of the balance of payments associated with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. In late March, the Bank of South Sudan committed to unifying the official and parallel exchange rates to alleviate the depreciation of the South Sudanese pound and reduce inflation.  20\. Food insecurity contributed to household hardships, with humanitarian organization struggling to fill the gap. In April 2021, the World Food Programme announced cuts in food rations to nearly 700,000 refugees and internally displaced people, who will receive 50 per cent of a full ration, down from 70 per cent.  21\. On 22 March, the Auditor General released a report on the accounts held at the Bank of South Sudan relating to the 2 and 3 per cent of net oil revenue designated for petroleum-producing states and communities, respectively. From July 2011 to 31 December 2020, $85,735,541 was deposited in both accounts. From 2014 to 2020, $84,062,073 was disbursed, of which payments of $55,925,556 were made to parties other than those stipulated under the Petroleum Revenue Management Act (2013). The audit did not examine how the money transferred to the states was used.","['Drought', 'Epidemic', 'Flood', 'Other']","['Food and Nutrition', 'Health', 'Mine Action', 'Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding', 'Protection and Human Rights', 'Safety and Security', 'Shelter and Non-Food Items']",['South Sudan'],UN Document
3784213,"**Executive Summary**  Compared to the average over the last 30 years (1990-2019), the occurrence and intensity of global natural disasters were generally at a lower level in 2020. Major natural disasters in 2020 were 4% less in frequency, 73% lower in deaths, 50% less in the population affected and 29% more in direct economic losses. In 2020, the frequency of extreme temperatures around the world was low, but the number of deaths from such events was the most, reaching 6343; flood disasters were the most frequent, 43% more than historic levels and causing 6171 deaths, but the flood-related deaths were 7% less than the historical average; the direct economic losses caused by storm disasters were large, reaching USD 93.2 billion and 64% more than historic levels; there were fewer strong earthquakes, with relatively small disaster losses; the number of deaths from wildfires decreased, but the direct economic losses were 172% higher than those in history. Regionally, Asia has seen the highest frequency of natural disasters in 2020, followed by Africa; among all continents, Europe has had the largest number of deaths due to disasters, followed by Asia; North America has seen the highest economic losses due to disasters, followed by Asia; compared with developed countries, developing countries were more severely affected by disasters, mostly floods and storms. In 2020, deaths from natural disasters in China were at a lower level in the world, and the proportion of direct economic losses in GDP was in the upper middle level, which were basically consistent with the level of its economic development. The flood losses in China were higher than those from other disasters, which accounted for a large proportion of the global flood losses.    Flood disasters were the major natural disasters affecting the world in 2020. The results of analysis of historical disaster losses show that in addition to single loss, we should also pay attention to cumulative loss in research and practice of flood risk management; in the future, while strengthening the prevention and control of flood events of medium intensity and above, we shall also pay closer attention to small and frequent flood disaster events so as to reduce flood-related fatalities.    By sorting out the flood disaster losses in China from 2009 to 2018, focusing on the flood disasters in southern China that occurred in the summer of 2020, and comparing them with typical flood events in history, the report finds that China has successfully mitigated major flood losses through a series of measures of integrated flood disaster risk reduction","['Drought', 'Earthquake', 'Flood', 'Heat Wave', 'Land Slide', 'Severe Local Storm', 'Tropical Cyclone', 'Wild Fire']",['Disaster Management'],"['China', 'World']",Analysis

3718238,"SC/14457  The transformation of South Sudan from conflict to recovery is under way, the senior United Nations official in the country told the Security Council today, as he urged the Transitional Government to build on hard-won gains made during its first year in office and accelerate implementation of the 2018 Revitalized Peace Agreement — or otherwise risk a return to widespread violence.  'Slow implementation comes with a cost,' David Shearer, Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), [told]( ) the Council during his final briefing after four years of service.  While welcoming the formation of the presidency and Council of Ministers, installment of a full complement of State leaders and announcement of lower-level officials, he said the Transitional National Legislature still waits to be reconstituted.  There has been minimal progress on constitution-making, transitional justice and economic reform — and perhaps most significantly — the unification of forces is yet to occur despite multiple self-imposed Government deadlines.  Thousands of troops fester in cantonment sites without shelter, health care or food.  He cautioned that the power vacuum at the local level has opened opportunities for spoilers and national actors to exploit local tensions and fuel violence, the impact of which was seen in Jonglei in 2020.  Today, in Warrap, there is a worrying surge in violence between heavily armed community militia that Government forces have yet to contain.  For the moment, conflict in the Equatorias has diminished.  On the humanitarian front, he said subnational conflict and devastation caused by flooding have created places of critical need, notably in Jonglei and Warrap.  Humanitarian agencies are providing assistance despite that nine aid workers lost their lives in 2020 while carrying out this work.  It is estimated that most of South Sudan requires food aid.  Across the country, UNMISS is supporting people in need, he said.  Engineers are building and improving 3,200 kilometres of roads — notably between Bor and Pibor, which the Mission hopes will aid reconciliation between Murle, Dinka and Nuer communities.  Work on a road linking the Sudan border to Bentiu and south to Rumbek, meanwhile, aims to increase trade for citizens in the impoverished areas.  'I cannot overstate the tangible impact of this work,' he said, in a country that currently has just 400 kilometers of paved road.  Improving roads boosts communication, trade, jobs ——and most critically — fosters peace by linking communities.  He went on to stress that the follow-on from the redesignations of the Bor, Wau and Juba protection-of-civilian sites has continued smoothly.  'This is all indicative of a changing context,' he assured.  In the long term, he described the goal of creating a protective environment where all citizens benefit from the rule of law, noting that UNMISS is looking to redeploy staff and resources to build the capacity of the courts, justice system and national police.  Individual police officers will train and mentor local police, while other initiatives focus on making the mobile courts permanent.  These efforts aim to place South Sudanese 'in the hot seat' to tackle impunity — particularly sexual violence.  For its part, UNMISS is prioritizing technical support for security sector reform and elections preparations, he said.  Its forces have been more mobile, establishing temporary bases and increasing patrols to hotspots.  Most of these initiatives involve civil affairs and human rights staff to bring communities together and deter violence.  Over the next two years, force numbers will gradually diminish by 7 per cent as the Mission shifts its resources to assets that will boost its mobility.  Turning to issues that require attention, he cited the absence of a financial system that works for the people of South Sudan, stressing that the country's wealth — notably from oil — is siphoned off with no public accountability for how it is spent.  Given the immense pride South Sudanese have in their country, the massive United Nations presence also will inevitably bump up against their hard-won sovereignty.  Yet, South Sudan is one of the most dependent nations in history, he said:  Its education and health systems, roads and infrastructure are provided by outsiders.  'We have too eagerly stepped in and shouldered responsibilities that should be the job of the South Sudanese,' he said, adding to their dependency, and thus, undermining their dignity.  'State-building is a finely tuned endeavour that constantly needs to be re-evaluated and questioned,' he observed.  Offering personal reflections, he described the comfort of witnessing a ceasefire, peace deal, transitional Government, presidency, Council of Ministers, Governors and local leaders slowly being installed.  The majority of people who flocked to protection-of-civilian sites have either left or now live in newly transitioned displaced person camps — a result of improved political security.  Overall, he said political violence has reduced 'by a power of 10' compared to the number of people who were dying or displaced from conflict in 2016.  He cited the upsurge in armed community militia, seemingly in open defiance of State forces, as a caveat.  Uniformed and civilian UNMISS staff make a real difference in lowering this kind of violence.  'The reality is, though, that the peace process remains extremely fragile,' he said.  'Look back four years:  that is what failure looks like and it is in no one's interests to return.'  Jackline Nasiwa, Founder and National Director, Centre for Inclusive Governance, Peace and Justice, said COVID-19 has devastated South Sudan, a country where the health-care system cannot even meet demands for the most basic services.  She described flooding in Upper Nile, ceasefire violations — including in cantonment sites — intercommunal violence, sexual violence against women and girls, displacement and an economy collapsing because of revenue mismanagement.  'This is South Sudan today.'  In the two years since the Peace Agreement was signed, parties have embarked on steps 'that appear to be only drops in the ocean'.  While the cantonment process was launched, the formation of a disarmament, demobilization and reintegration commission announced, and bills drafted on security and governance, 'much, much more remains to be done', she said, expressing deep concern over the unacceptably slow pace of implementing the Peace Agreement and lack of political will as people suffer.  'Our leaders must be held accountable for implementing key aspects of the Agreement,' she stressed.  Around the country, people are demanding accountability and justice for women and children who have suffered conflict-related violence.  They are saying 'never again' and insisting upon an end to the war.  She called for close monitoring of the Peace Agreement, the establishment of a transitional justice mechanism, adoption of draft laws, operationalization of cantonment sites and support for disarmament, demobilization and reintegration efforts.  'Human rights must be the foundation of all these processes,' she asserted.  Pointing out that South Sudan is subject to a binding international framework that supports women's representation, she said the 35 per cent quota is 'far from being met'.  The few women who have been appointed comprise less than 20 per cent of leaders at the national and state levels, and only 2 per cent at the county level.  She described a male-dominated society in a country with a long history of marginalization, stressing that 'the Council must pressure the parties' to ensure the 35 per cent quota is met at all levels of governance.  She urged the Council to partner with civil society in advocating for the freedom of speech and access to information, with strong support for those facing intimidation for carrying out their essential work.  'Peace and stability are the only assurance of the future of our communities,' she emphasized.  Recalling that 11 South Sudanese women have briefed the Council to date, she said they are tired of sharing the same stories of war and loss.  After enduring decades of conflict, resilience is fading.  The history of South Sudan is one of struggle for dignity, however, 'we can struggle no more,' she said.  'We need this Council to act now, before even worse happens.'  The representative of Viet Nam said the progress so far is encouraging, but the implementation of the 2018 Peace Agreement remains limited, calling on the South Sudanese parties to step up efforts particularly in finalizing two key provisions:  reconstitution of the Transitional National Legislative Assembly and formation of the Unified Forces.  The permanent ceasefire must continue to be upheld, he said, urging the Government to put in more efforts to address intercommunal violence to prevent possible adverse impact on the current transitional period.  While the country experiences positive economic growth, it is concerning that the high level of food insecurity continues to affect more than half of the population.  Reiterating that sanctions measures are subjected to review in accordance with developments on the ground and shall be removed when the conditions are met, he said Viet Nam looks forward to receiving the report of the Secretariat on the proposals of the benchmarks to review the arms embargo and will actively engage Council members on the establishment of such benchmarks.  As Chair of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 2206 (2015) concerning South Sudan, Hanoi will also continue to foster cooperation and dialogue between the Panel of Experts, South Sudan and the relevant regional States.  The representative of Kenya, also speaking for Niger, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Tunisia, welcomed the overall improvement in South Sudan's political and security situations.  However, the implementation of some key governance activities continues to lag; in particular, the reconstitution of the Transitional National Legislature.  Urging the parties to move forward on that front expeditiously, and to finalize the ongoing appointments of state officials, he joined other speakers in spotlighting the crucial principle of inclusivity — including the implementation of the agreed minimum of 35 per cent quota for women.  Noting with concern the slow progress in implementing transitional security arrangements, he cited the lack of technical capacity and resources and pointed to a training on leadership, peacebuilding and reconstruction recently held in Nairobi.  Continued regional and international support is crucial, including through robust diplomatic and political engagement, technical assistance and financial and logistical assistance.  Turning to the upcoming Mission review, he stated:  'The expectations of the people of South Sudan and the region is that the new UNMISS mandate should be calibrated to respond to the evolving political and security situation.'  It must be also be adequately resourced, he added.  The representative of Mexico expressed cautious optimism about recent developments in South Sudan, including the appointment of key officials.  While slow, such strides are encouraging and solidify the governance of the country's states.  However, he expressed concern about the increase of attacks on civilians in 2020, advocating for efforts to address the factors that drive conflict — including the flow of small arms — and called for South Sudan's weapons collection programme to be prioritized.  Any review of the arms embargo must be conducted in light of the situation on the ground, including the country's capacity to control the flow of weapons.  Drawing attention to the appalling plight of women and girls who remain subjected to sexual and gender-related crimes, he underlined the need to adhere to the Revitalized Peace Agreement's stipulations regarding redress.  He also joined other speakers in expressing concern over South Sudan's humanitarian situation — calling for the free movement of humanitarian personnel to be guaranteed in line with international law — and advocated for the renewal of UNMISS' crucial mandate.  The representative of China said South Sudan and its people have made many strides since the country's establishment in 2011.  Stressing the need to maintain positive momentum in implementing the Revitalized Peace Agreement, he called on all parties to consolidate existing gains and make further strides on security arrangements, while acknowledging that the implementation of the accord faces practical difficulties, including a lack of funding.  In that vein, he said, the global community should respond to the African Union's calls and lift sanctions as soon as possible.  Meanwhile, ongoing intercommunal clashes require a mix of support, from prevention to mediation and protection strategies, and more efforts to tackle the underlying drivers of conflict.  He also emphasized the need to expand COVID-19 vaccine access, outlining China's support for South Sudan in that arena.  Welcoming the important role played by UNMISS, he voiced support for the renewal of its mandate, adding that the implementation of the Revitalized Peace Agreement — as well as cooperation with the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and other regional groups — should be among its prioritized tasks.  The representative of Norway said implementation of the Revitalized Peace Agreement remains slow, and too limited.  While welcoming the appointment of a unified Cabinet, Governors and Deputy Governors in all states — as well as the endorsement by the Council of Ministers of a road map for implementing Chapter 5 of the Agreement — she called for full implementation of the accord.  As almost no progress has been made on the Transitional Security Arrangements and security sector reform, parties must take immediate steps towards the unification of forces.  She also called for the formation of all state governments and legislatures, the reconstitution of the Transitional National Legislative Assembly and Council of States, and launch of the permanent constitution making process, along with preparations for peaceful elections.  Parties must adhere to the provision of 35 per cent female representation in political positions, while the Government must implement reforms envisaged in Chapter 4 regarding transparency and accountability.  Expressing deep concern over violence across the country, she urged the Government to ensure immediate de-escalation of subnational conflict and to allow unimpeded humanitarian access.  Arbitrary arrests and detention of persons exercising their freedom of expression or peaceful assembly are also worrying, she said.  The representative of the United Kingdom welcomed the appointment of a unified Cabinet, Governors and Deputy Governors in all South Sudanese states.  'We hope that those appointed can deliver tangible improvements to people's lives,' he said, also praising the endorsement of a road map for implementing transitional justice mechanisms and urging the Government to sign a memorandum of understanding with the African Union on the Hybrid Court.  Nevertheless, he said, overall progress remains too slow and limited.  The Council repeatedly expresses its concerns and calls the authorities to act, only to see inaction.  'The Government must pick up its feet and show the world that it is serious about peace,' he stressed, pointing out that the representative of South Sudan has not attended a Council meeting in a year's time, having complained that his country is too often criticized.  Indeed, he said, if the Government spent more time listening to other voices than worrying about being criticized, more might be achieved.  What is needed now is the reconstitution of the Transitional National Legislative Assembly and training and resources for the Necessary Unified Forces, he said, noting that while such action does not require an easing of the arms embargo, the Government is free to submit exemption requests should it wish to do so.  The representative of France welcomed the progress made in implementing the Revitalized Peace Agreement and the announcement of a hybrid court to be finalized by the African Union.  'This trend should be maintained and continued by new measures,' she said.  Calling for the establishment of a Transitional National Legislative Assembly and a truth and reconciliation commission, she said security sector reform is also needed.  Recalling the 35 per cent quota for women's participation, she likewise called for the participation of young people in various decisions.  Local violence, often playing out in connection with national players, affects women and children in particular, and she urged all parties to respect their international humanitarian law obligations.  Fair access to a COVID‑19 vaccine, in accordance with resolution 2565 (2021), is also essential.  The representative of India described the recent progress made in South Sudan as a welcome departure from months of impasse.  However, the country continues to face challenges in implementing its Revitalized Peace Agreement, including political defections, lack of trust at all levels and growing intercommunal clashes.  Joining other speakers in citing the lack of a coherent security strategy and funding as major impediments, he called on the parties to work in good faith and set aside narrow political considerations.  Recalling that the Council has committed to an ongoing review of all sanctions imposed on South Sudan, he advocated for a clear benchmarking process to assess the arms embargo, assets freeze and travel ban components, in full consultation with the Government of South Sudan and other regional stakeholders.  Meanwhile, the humanitarian situation remains worrying, marked by intercommunal violence, displacement, flooding, attacks on humanitarian workers and the impacts of COVID-19.  The global community should tackle the $1 billion funding gap, he said, noting that India recently provided 70 metric tons of food aid and announced a gift of 200,000 doses of 'Made in India' COVID-19 vaccines for United Nations peacekeepers.  The representative of Estonia said that despite some seemingly positive developments, the international community must not turn a blind eye on everything else.  The security sector reform is behind schedule due to a lack of a coherent strategy, funding and political will.  The establishment of key transitional justice institutions, like the Hybrid Courts, has not been implemented.  Serious and widespread violations and abuses continued in 2020.  There was a 146 per cent increase in incidents, with the number of documented civilian victims up 120 per cent.  'These are the hard facts on the ground, which matter the most to us,' he said.  Commending the conviction of soldiers for conflict-related sexual offenses, he expressed hope that this will build momentum towards accountability and that the appointment of state Governors can turn the situation around.  The representative of the Russian Federation said her country will continue to support efforts to stabilize South Sudan, noting that UNMISS sent two infantry companies and two helicopters to strengthen security in neighbouring Central African Republic.  The formation of a Transitional Government and conclusion of the pre-transitional period have created the conditions for moving towards stability and reconciliation, she said, also pointing to steady improvement in humanitarian access as proof that Juba has responded properly to international signals to accelerate political settlement and State-building efforts.  She welcomed the finalization of executive bodies at state and county levels, the graduation of the first soldiers of the joint armed forces, and that parties have agreed on a candidate for Upper Nile State.  She called on those who have not signed the Revitalized Peace Agreement to join the State-building process, expressing concern over intercommunal clashes, and condemning all ceasefire violations and violence against civilians.  She called for a review of the sanctions regime to adapt it to realities on the ground, noting that the Council will soon agree on the benchmarks for reviewing these restrictions.  On the whole, the Russian Federation agrees with the conclusions outlined in the Secretary-General's report and will work to extend the Mission's mandate, she said, calling at the same time on peacekeepers to focus on a political settlement and ensuring that the conditions for facilitating humanitarian assistance are in place.  The representative of Ireland, noting some recent progress in implementing the Revitalized Peace Agreement, called for more concrete steps forward, continued engagement by regional bodies and the commitment by all parties to the ceasefire.  Voicing concern over the significant bloodshed throughout 2020 as well as continued human right violations — particularly against women and girls — she strongly condemned all acts of conflict-related sexual violence.  While it should never happen in the first place, when it does, South Sudanese authorities have a responsibility to protect victims and survivors and provide survivor-centred support services.  She went on to call on the authorities to accelerate the establishment of all institutions of Government, implementing the 35 per cent quota for women, and to enact an overall security strategy that provides an inclusive and comprehensive framework for decision-making.  She noted the crucial UNMISS function of civilian protection, while also spotlighting the Government's responsibility to protect its people, including in transitioned camps.  The representative of the United States, President of the Security Council, speaking in her national capacity, said civil society members, particularly women, must be heard during discussions of the 15-member organ.  'Their ears are on the ground.  They see and understand what no one does.  And at times, they suffer as no one else does,' she said, which is why the United States will place civil society representatives at the highest levels of diplomacy and decision-making.  She condemned reprisals against those who engage with the United Nations, recounting her visits to South Sudan and work with its leaders.  'I care deeply about the forward progress of this nation,' she assured.  While welcoming the commitment to form the Transitional Government, she called for more steady progress towards a lasting power-sharing agreement, expressing extreme concern over signs that political actors are involved in subnational fighting.  'That is not peace and that is not acceptable,' she emphasized.  With an estimated 7 million people facing severe food insecurity, she denounced efforts by Government officials and others to impede humanitarian access, stressing that 'this cannot be tolerated by the international community'.  Leaders must ensure an immediate de-escalation of subnational conflict and allow unimpeded aid access.  Accelerating implementation of the 2018 Peace Agreement is also essential, as stalling risks a return of widespread political violence.  It is 'far past time' to establish the Transitional National Legislative Assembly and draft the constitution, she added, expressing alarm over gender-based violence committed by security services and armed groups.  Security services must be vetted, trained and unified under a single chain of command.  As South Sudan navigates its transition, UNMISS will remain critical to its security, humanitarian and human rights architecture, and in supporting the Government's implementation of the Peace Agreement.  Stressing that restrictions on its movement violate the status of forces agreement and endanger peacekeepers, she urged leaders to stop obstructing its work.  Any force reduction should be gradual and conditions-based.  'We see the situation in South Sudan as precarious,' she asserted.  Leaders must implement the 2018 accord, lower the violence, work with UNMISS and open the gates for humanitarian access.  **For information media.

3813422,"Responding to the news that two children in IDP camps have died in their tents from severe cold weather in rural Idlib, Sonia Khush, Director of Save the Children's Syria Response Office, said:   'Save the Children is devastated by the news that a seven-day-old girl and a two months-old girl have died in tents in rural Idlib due to severe cold. Every winter, displaced children and their families in this area are forced to endure unimaginably cold temperatures without warm clothes, food and heating to protect them.  'It is incomprehensible that any child should face the winter scared for their life. Almost 11 years after the crisis in Syria started, it feels like the world has forgotten about children in North West Syria. These avoidable and tragic deaths are a dreadful example of how children urgently need more humanitarian support. They also need a lasting, peaceful solution to Syria's conflict so no more children freeze to death in tents.'  We have spokespeople available.

In addition, rapid urban growth and environmental degradation in some countries have led to overcrowding and settlement in hazard-prone areas. Protracted conflict and limited government disaster management capacity in many EMCA countries compound the risks associated with natural disasters.  - During FY 2015, USAID/OFDA responded to large-scale complex crises in EMCA while supporting DRR activities where the situation allowed. USAID/OFDA facilitated ongoing DRR efforts that built resilience and improved emergency preparedness, mitigation, and response capacity at the local, national, and regional levels. In FY 2015, USAID/OFDA provided more than $1.4 million for DRR projects throughout EMCA.","['Earthquake', 'Insect Infestation']","['Contributions', 'Disaster Management']","['Armenia', 'Azerbaijan', 'Georgia', 'Kazakhstan', 'Kyrgyzstan', 'occupied Palestinian territory', 'Russian Federation', 'Tajikistan', 'Turkmenistan', 'United States of America', 'Uzbekistan', 'Yemen']",Situation Report

Thanks to generous contributions from partners, the appeal is currently around 40 percent funded. This includes flexible emergency funding from both public and private partners, which enables UNICEF to use resources to respond to rising and sudden needs. Some contributions received in 2021 continue to enable implementation in 2022, together with additional support received this year. UNICEF is grateful to the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund, the governments of Germany and the Republic of Korea, and UNICEF's family of National Committees for contributions received in the last month. UNICEF will continue to partner with donors to ensure sufficient resources are mobilized to address the needs of children and communities in Afghanistan. UNICEF developed and disseminated a winter strategy and is seeking US$ 75 million for winter activities and funding needs ahead of the onset of the harsh winter season.  **Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs**  The preliminary results of the Whole of Afghanistan Assessment (WoAA) conducted in August and September 2022, show a precarious situation in Afghanistan. While the humanitarian response has prevented a catastrophe, the situation has not improved, with some sectors, such as WASH, seeing a deterioration. Economic shock and drought have fully taken over conflict and COVID-19 as the major drivers of poverty, with needs surpassing most humanitarian thresholds. This requires a shift in the focus of our response. Despite humanitarian partners delivering historic levels of response in 2022, there are more people today who rely on humanitarian assistance as the only source of survival. Moreover, a recent UNDP socio-economic snapshot reportshowsthat the economy lost US$ 5 billion since August 2021, essentially reversing almost all achievements of the last decade. The report further indicates that poorer households spend 60% of their income on food and sold their assets to survive through the first winter.1 Prices of food and fuel remain significantly higher than last year despite recent declines. Households in rural areas have begun stocking food for the winter and lean seasons, however, due to elevated food prices, purchasing power remains below average. In addition, with casual labour demand and wage rates at lower levels, some households can only afford 80% of the minimum food basket (MFB).  Security incidents continue to affect populations across the country. On 30 September, a suicide attack at a Kaaj tuition centre in the Dasht-e-Barchi area in Kabul has killed at least 53 people and injured over 110, most of them female students. Students had been sitting a practice university exam when the incident happened. No group has yet claimed the attack, however the attack continues to highlight the insecurity students, particularly females, when furthering their education.  As winter sets in, cases of Acute Watery Diarrhoea (AWD) are decreasing across the country. 42,921 cases of AWD were reported during in September, bringing the total since the beginning of May's outbreak to 184,975 cases, with around 55% being children under five years old. However, the winter season brings additional risks such as acute respiratory infections (ARI), increased household debt due to increased expenditure needs, and access to services due to snowfall.   UNICEF's Winter Strategy, targeting over 800,000 individuals, aims to alleviate these needs through a combination of prepositioning lifesaving supplies and distributing multi-purpose cash to enable households to meet their urgent humanitarian needs.","['Drought', 'Earthquake', 'Epidemic', 'Flash Flood']","['Contributions', 'Coordination', 'Education', 'Food and Nutrition', 'Health', 'Protection and Human Rights', 'Recovery and Reconstruction', 'Water Sanitation Hygiene']",['Afghanistan'],Situation Report

This incredible fundraising total is thanks to the generosity of the UK public and includes a private donation by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in early September. Her Majesty supported DEC appeals over many years, helping people around the world in their hour of greatest need.  The appeal also received support from Their Majesties King Charles III and The Queen Consort, Their Royal Highnesses The Prince and Princess of Wales as well as Nobel laureate and activist Malala Yousafzai and writer and broadcaster Adil Ray OBE.   The total also includes £5 million matched by the UK Government through the Aid Match scheme. DEC member charities are already on the ground delivering life-saving aid.  Mother of five Naseebo Mai, received assistance from Tearfund partner REEDS Pakistan in Rajanpur District, Punjab:  'In the beginning the water came very slowly so we didn't realise how serious the situation was, and then very suddenly the water was overwhelming. We managed to take a few items from home, but the flood has left me and my family with basically nothing. REEDS Pakistan team reached us in the hour of our hard time and supplied my family with cooked food, safe drinking water and a tent for temporary shelter. Without that help I really don't know what we would have done.'   Eleven of the DEC's member charities are currently responding in Pakistan. Appeal funds will be used to provide food aid and nutritional treatments, distribute cash grants, provide clean water and sanitation facilities, emergency medical care, temporary shelter and trauma counselling.   DEC Chief Executive Saleh Saeed said:  ""We have seen an amazing response to this deeply shocking disaster, and we are so grateful to all who have supported the appeal for their generosity. We are deeply moved by the donation made by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and are immensely grateful to Her Majesty for the generous support she gave to the DEC over many years.  'This incredible outpouring of support has enabled DEC charities to provide essential aid and to relieve some of the suffering faced by millions of people in Pakistan right now.   'But the scale of this devastation means we need to do much more if we are to protect the many men, women and children facing weeks and months of hunger and disease and whose lives and livelihoods have been destroyed.   'We are therefore asking those who can afford to help to donate what they can ' these funds are literally a lifeline for some of the world's most vulnerable people at a time of desperate need.'   The new appeal total is announced as concerns continue about the spread of water-borne diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, malaria and dengue, causing further devastation to millions inside Pakistan.  Mr. Ashfaque Somooro, Executive Director of Research and Development Foundation, local partner of DEC member International Rescue Committee (IRC) said:  'Due to the lack of adequate sanitation and safe water facilities, flood victims are left at severe risk of water and vector borne diseases, and we are already witnessing an increase in gastrointestinal illness among affected people. We are afraid that worsening conditions will endanger the health and lives of the population - particularly children and pregnant mothers.'

3751157,"FREEPORT, Grand Bahama -- Minister of State for Disaster Preparedness, Management and Reconstruction, the Hon. Pakesia Parker-Edgecombe says the formation of the Ministry of Disaster Preparedness, Management and Reconstruction signifies just how serious the Minnis Administration is about putting in place a ministry that is specifically designed to address disaster risk management and mitigation.  She noted that The Bahamas is the only one in the region, thus far, to do so.  'As my Ministry moves forward in strengthening policy and legislation surrounding disaster preparedness, management and reconstruction, we do so recognizing that we too have a role to play,' Minister Parker-Edgecombe noted.  'There must be stronger working systems and shelters; an increase in capacity, better communication. There must be put in place legislation that protects each and every one of you. As many of you would have also lost during the storm, while helping the government of the day and helping others. It is only right.'  The State Minister's remarks came during a service of appreciation for the volunteers of Hurricane Dorian, for their acts of kindness shown before, during and following the devastating hurricane. The service was held on Thursday, June 24, 2021, at Calvary Temple Assemblies of God.  Minister Parker-Edgecombe pointed out that the government is focused on putting in place safety measures for all Bahamians.  'The mandatory evacuation orders have since come into effect,' she noted. 'Our country remains an active member of the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency (CDEMA). We are insured as a nation in the event of a disaster. The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) continues to solidify its mandate of preparing and managing disasters and the newly formed Disaster Reconstruction Authority is progressing in its recovery and reconstruction efforts.  'We are a coastal nation and amidst climate change, we recognized the need for focused attention in this sector. It is a proactive approach, rather than that of reaction. Hurricanes have been the main disasters experienced in our country, and while that is the case, we must position ourselves to fight any disaster that comes our way.'  Parker-Edgecombe encouraged those volunteers present to continue to take part in the training that is available. She admonished them to speak to family and friends about coming into the fold of service, because all Bahamians need each other to survive.  'Every sector present here today is important,' she added. 'We cannot work in silos. We must join hands tightly. The common goal being saving lives amidst any disaster. I am truly honored to be here with you, recognizing that each and every one of you present here today, epitomizes the true essence of being your brother's keeper and for that we are grateful. Because of you, many lives have been saved over the years, most recently during Hurricane Dorian.'  The Minister of State noted that Hurricane Dorian, was undoubtedly the worst storm that the Commonwealth has ever experienced. She said major devastation was incurred and not only did people lose properties and homes, but many people lost loved ones.  Minister Parker-Edgecombe admitted that while preparation took place at best, no one expected the ferocity that came along with a category five hurricane.  'We are not all the same,' she said. 'Our lives will not be the same. 2019 and 2020 in particular, have changed us forever. Not only have we had to rebuild following Hurricane Dorian, but we have had to face the COVID-19 pandemic amidst it. We are being tested and we are being tried. Our homes and communities, left vulnerable.  'I am a believer, however, that all that has been done, especially the sacrifices made on your part, is the foundation that will ensure that as we rebuild, we do so even stronger. Today you are all being recognized. You did not have to do what you did. You could have chosen to stay indoors and carry on with your lives. You could have chosen to sit back and watch. You could have chosen to have someone else step forward, but you came forward.

3779309,"The report seeks to take stock of the housing, land and property framework and the multiple forms in which housing vulnerability is playing out in the context of the repair and recovery phase of Beirut in the aftermath of the port blast.　　  The methodology adopted for this study is qualitative and consists of laying out housing issues and threats in the context of the areas affected by the blast to unravel the full spectrum of housing, land and property challenges in Beirut.  Based on a mapping of these challenges, the research strategy relied on an in-depth analysis of thirty case studies. Interviews were also conducted with residents, property owners and key informants.  During the analysis phase, the cases were examined in relation to their intersection with the legal framework, housing-related policies, and the urban and building regulations in place. Six forms of major shelter vulnerability that characterize dwellers in blast-affected areas were investigated; (a) Poor housing conditions, (b) Tenure vulnerability, (c) Neighbourhood threats, (d) Affordability issues, (e) Blast specific factors, and (f) Individual vulnerability.  The findings were consolidated and synthesized to inform the report's recommendations to improve housing conditions for vulnerable populations in Beirut through three levels: national policymaking, area-specific, and household level interventions.  **Main findings:**    - The report identifies three critical contextual factors for consideration in Beirut's post-blast recovery related to housing, land, and property. These factors are: (i) a weak and malfunctioning institutional setup, (ii) a poor regulatory framework, and (iii) high public reliance on foreign aid and donor assistance    - Deficiencies in the organization of the housing sector were extended to the regulatory framework of the post-blast recovery    - Many of the households living in the neighbourhoods affected by the blast suffered already from poor housing conditions.    - Forms of tenure within the areas affected by the blast play a significant role in increasing housing insecurity and vulnerability for numerous households    - The blast has generated specific new forms of vulnerability.    - A high level of informality governs the processes through which the vast majority of vulnerable dwellers access shelter in the areas of the post-blast recovery.    - The possibilities for a post-blast reconstruction are undermined by heightened vulnerability, raising costs of services, increasing incidence of eviction due to the inability to pay rent, delays related to repairs and eroded capabilities of public agencies.    - Addressing the housing challenge in Lebanon is a long process that requires a societal change vis-à-vis the conception of land and property and its translation into an actual enactment of the right to adequate housing.",['Technological Disaster'],['Recovery and Reconstruction'],['Lebanon'],Analysis

Historical eruptions date back to 1700; twentieth-century eruptions were mildly explosive until 1967. Its most recent eruption occurred during late June through early October 2019 and was characterized by a new vent, lava fountaining and a flow, and ash plumes (BGVN 44:12). A new eruption was reported during July 2021 and consisted of ash plumes, gas-and-steam emissions, and brief thermal anomalies. This report covers activity during July through November 2021 with information from Rabaul Volcano Observatory (RVO), the Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC), and satellite data.  Activity after October 2019 and throughout 2020 was relatively low; RVO reported that intermittent white gas-and-steam plumes rose from the Main Crater during late December into early February. Occasional emissions rose from WSW flank by the October 2019 vent and lava flow. A webcam sometimes recorded nighttime incandescence from this same area during late December into early January 2020. RVO reported mudflows during mid-January that deposited material on the upper flanks. Seismicity through early February 2020 was low, with RSAM values no higher than 200 units.  During the first half of 2021 activity remained relatively low. Data from the TROPOMI instrument on the Sentinel-5P satellite showed a strong sulfur dioxide concentration on 26 January. Some periods of increased seismicity were recorded during 4-8, 24-25, 26-28, and 29-30 June (figure 27). Occasional high-frequency volcano-tectonic earthquakes were also detected. TROPOMI identified weaker sulfur dioxide emissions drifting generally W on 4 and 7 July (figure 28). Sentinel-2 infrared satellite imagery showed a small thermal anomaly in the summit crater on 9 and 14 July (figure 29), with a weaker anomaly on 24 July partially obscured by a steam plume. The Darwin VAAC issued one notice on 29 July and two on 3 August, reporting ash plumes that rose to 3 and 3.4 km altitude, and drifted E and SSE, respectively, according to pilot reports. Weather clouds prevented clear views in satellite imagery. Another weak SO2 plume was present on 5 August.  In early November RVO reported that very small, discrete, seismic events had been recorded over the previous several months by the seismometer located 5 km from the summit on the SW flank. No surface activity was noted until a small thermal anomaly was identified in satellite images around 0500 on 3 November, according to RVO. At 0800 that same day, RSAM values increased to 100, and by 1115 they had increased further to 1,400. Values continued to fluctuate between 100 and 1,000 units at least through 1300. Tremors were detected on a seismometer at Ulamona (11-12 km NW from the summit) during periods with higher RSAM values. Gas-and-steam emissions continued to be visible above the crater. On 30 November the Darwin VAAC raised the Aviation Color Code to Orange (the second highest level on a four-color scale), due to reports from local observers who described increased seismicity, gas-and-steam emissions, and a small ash eruption on the 29th.  ***Geological Summary.*** The symmetrical basaltic-to-andesitic Ulawun stratovolcano is the highest volcano of the Bismarck arc, and one of Papua New Guinea's most frequently active. The volcano, also known as the Father, rises above the N coast of the island of New Britain across a low saddle NE of Bamus volcano, the South Son. The upper 1,000 m is unvegetated. A prominent E-W escarpment on the south may be the result of large-scale slumping. Satellitic cones occupy the NW and E flanks. A steep-walled valley cuts the NW side, and a flank lava-flow complex lies to the south of this valley. Historical eruptions date back to the beginning of the 18th century. Twentieth-century eruptions were mildly explosive until 1967, but after 1970 several larger eruptions produced lava flows and basaltic pyroclastic flows, greatly modifying the summit crater.  ***Information Contacts:*** *Rabaul Volcano Observatory (RVO),* Geohazards Management Division, Department of Mineral Policy and Geohazards Management (DMPGM), PO Box 3386, Kokopo, East New Britain Province, Papua New Guinea; *Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC),* Bureau of Meteorology, Northern Territory Regional Office, PO Box 40050, Casuarina, NT 0811, Australia (URL:  ); *NASA Global Sulfur Dioxide Monitoring Page*, Atmospheric Chemistry and Dynamics Laboratory, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA/GSFC), 8800 Greenbelt Road, Goddard, Maryland, USA (URL:  ); *Sentinel Hub Playground* (URL:  ).",['Volcano'],,['Papua New Guinea'],News and Press Release
3772994,"Press Release     For Immediate Release     Friday, September 10, 2021  The United States, through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), is providing $100,000 in immediate assistance to support people affected by ongoing drought in Kazakhstan. Severe drought has left pastures in affected regions unable to support livestock, resulting in the deaths of thousands of cows and horses. The drought has also devastated crops and depleted already scarce freshwater resources. Between increasing food prices and the loss of livestock, the drought has affected tens of thousands of people.   With today's funding, USAID is working with the Red Crescent of Kazakhstan to assist people affected by ongoing drought. Many families in the drought-affected areas rely solely on livestock for their income. With their livestock gone, USAID assistance will help these families purchase household items to meet their daily needs.  USAID has disaster experts in the region who are assessing humanitarian needs and coordinating closely with the Government of Kazakhstan and humanitarian organizations on response efforts.","['Drought', 'Heat Wave']",['Contributions'],"['Kazakhstan', 'United States of America']",News and Press Release

3913452,"**HIGHLIGHTS**  -   East Asia and the Pacific remains the region most prone to natural hazards worldwide, with an average of 122 million people affected yearly throughout the region. This is severely exacerbated by the negative impacts of climate change and often compounded by such human-caused hazards as conflict and civil unrest. It is estimated that annual economic losses arising from climate-related risks could reach 4.2 per cent of regional gross domestic product under the worst case climate change scenario. -   UNICEF engages in a holistic disaster risk management approach to support country offices, governments and partners by strengthening emergency preparedness, building local and national capacities and providing technical expertise for child-sensitive, gender-informed and disability-inclusive humanitarian action. -   UNICEF maintains an agile system to rapidly deploy funding and technical capacity from the regional and global rosters to quickly respond to sudden-onset events. -   UNICEF is seeking US$29 million to respond to these critical needs in 2023, including US$25.4 million for emergency response and US$3.6 million for emergency preparedness, disaster risk reduction, climate resilience and cross-sectoral support. Twenty-four countries and territories are directly covered by this regional appeal.  **HUMANITARIAN SITUATION**  East Asia and the Pacific remains the most disaster-prone region in the world. Over the past 50 years, natural hazards in Asia and the Pacific have affected 6.9 billion people and killed more than 2 million. Several countries situated along the Pacific Ring of Fire are prone to earthquakes, volcanic activity and tsunamis. In January 2022, an underwater volcano in the Pacific near Tonga erupted violently, shooting a 5 km-wide plume of ash, steam and gas into theair, affecting 84 per cent of the Tongan population, including 36,500 children.  The region is also significantly affected by the negative impacts of climate change, with the more frequent occurrence of more intense cyclones, floods and droughts. In December 2021, Super Typhoon Rai (local name Odette) swept over the Philippines, leaving 2.4 million people, including 912,000 children, in need of humanitarian assistance. The La Niña weather phenomenon, which has already caused prolonged drought in the equatorial Pacific, affecting more than 100,000 people in the Pacific Island States of Kiribati and Tuvalu, headed in 2022 into its third consecutive year, further increasing the risk of extreme weather events across the region.  In addition, protracted crises and migration due to unresolved conflict and ethnic strife in several countries in the region continue to affect the lives of children and their families and infringe upon their human rights. Disasters, conflict and migration increase the risk of different forms of gender-based violence, especially for women and girls. Girls and boys, including those with disabilities, are exposed to heightened risks of physical and emotional violence, abuse and exploitation. This is exacerbated by the socioeconomic impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which include high malnutrition levels, school dropout and rising poverty levels and are still felt in most countries in the region.  **HUMANITARIAN STRATEGY**  The UNICEF East Asia and the Pacific Regional Office will focus on enhancing the emergency preparedness and response capabilities of country offices, government counterparts and partners by establishing adequate preparedness measures and providing technical expertise and strengthening systems for child-sensitive and child-inclusive humanitarian action, in line with the Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action. UNICEF will expand its capacity-building programme for national disaster management agencies and line ministries in the region, which was successfully piloted in Viet Nam and the Philippines.   To respond rapidly to sudden-onset emergencies in the region, the East Asia and Pacific Regional Office maintains an agile system to rapidly deploy funding and technical capacity from the regional roster. This is instrumental in enabling country offices to swiftly start providing life-saving emergency support to children and their families in the areas of health, nutrition, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), child protection, education and cash assistance.   UNICEF will also support governments and partners to strengthen capacities for social and behavioural change, child-centred disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. To support a risk-informed programming approach, thereby contributing to the humanitarian-development-peace nexus, UNICEF will analyse multidimensional risks and threats to children; integrate disaster risk reduction and climate change strategies into development plans; and build inclusive shock-responsive social protection systems.   UNICEF will continue to strengthen cross-sectoral efforts to holistically support early childhood development in emergencies and address the needs of children with disabilities, adolescents and women and girls in humanitarian settings, focusing on gender-based violence, accountability to affected populations and the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse.   To ensure greater predictability and accountability in humanitarian settings and learn from previous emergencies, UNICEF will continue to evaluate its humanitarian work and advance knowledge management and evidence-based humanitarian innovations.","['Drought', 'Epidemic', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Tropical Cyclone', 'Tsunami', 'Volcano']","['Disaster Management', 'Education', 'Food and Nutrition', 'Health', 'Protection and Human Rights', 'Water Sanitation Hygiene']","['Cambodia', 'China', 'Cook Islands', 'Fiji', 'Indonesia', 'Kiribati', ""Lao People's Democratic Republic (the)"", 'Malaysia', 'Marshall Islands', 'Micronesia (Federated States of)', 'Mongolia', 'Nauru', 'Niue (New Zealand)', 'Palau', 'Papua New Guinea', 'Philippines', 'Samoa', 'Solomon Islands', 'Thailand', 'Timor-Leste', 'Tokelau', 'Tonga', 'Tuvalu', 'Vanuatu', 'Viet Nam']",Appeal
3775011,"**Annual report 2020: Thanks to you, last year we helped more than ever before**  In 2020 Islamic Relief was able to reach more people than ever before, thanks to the generous support of our donors and the hard work of our dedicated staff and volunteers. Even in the face of the Covid pandemic, we assisted an unprecedented 13.8 million people in 39 countries.   **Despite the economic uncertainty so many faced our incredible supporters gave more generously than ever, bringing our annual income to £149 million. This was a striking increase of nearly 14% on 2019, and we spent 88p of every pound directly on helping people in need.**  [Our 2020 Annual Report]( ) marks 36 years of continued growth for one of the world's largest relief and development charities, while facing the unprecedented challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic.  'During a year of extraordinary challenges, we remained by the sides of millions of the world's most vulnerable people,' says Waseem Ahmad, our CEO. 'With faith and hope, Islamic Relief continues to do all it can to secure a safe and just world for all, no matter what challenges we face.'  **We provided essential support during times of crisis**  Spending nearly £59 million on delivering 370 emergency projects in 2020, we responded swiftly and effectively to some of the world's most devastating crises.  Rapidly adapting our operations in light of the global pandemic, we continued to assist families suffering amid conflict and natural disasters and helped protect millions of people in 26 countries from the devastating consequences of coronavirus.  'Islamic Relief offered us the opportunity to be part of the emergency response and provide relief to families who were affected the most by Covid-19,' says Miriam Gaisar Seco, an Islamic Relief supporter living in Madrid, Spain.  'There are no words to describe how I feel knowing that by supporting Islamic Relief, I have been able to reach someone in need, somewhere around the world. It is a feeling that will always be in my heart.'  Islamic Relief also built community resilience, helping over 127,000 individuals to better protect themselves when disaster strikes.  In war-torn Yemen we reached 3.6 million people through malnutrition treatment, support for health centres and food distributions as the main implementing partner for the UN World Food Programme. In Syria we supported 1.25 million people with access to lifesaving healthcare, emergency food and winter survival items.   **We spent more on development**  In line with our strategy, we spent more on development programmes ' the longer-term initiatives that aim to rebuild lives and lift communities out of poverty. We invested £55 million to deliver 364 life-changing projects, such as one in Iraq that helped Christian and Yazidi communities to rebuild livelihoods shattered by violence.  'It rekindled my spirit,' says Munisa, who we trained as a youth peace advocate in the Philippines. 'It made me think that Allah may have a plan for me… that I have a role to play in the building of peace.' Our major peace programme ' funded by the Swedish government's aid department, Sida ' put women and young people at the heart of local peacebuilding in multiple countries.   In addition we provided around 180,000 children and adults with access to education, and enabled over 735,000 people to earn a reliable income.  Giving 692,000 individuals access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene facilities, we also supported a record 72,000 vulnerable children worldwide through our orphan sponsorship programme.  **We campaigned for social justice**  Islamic Relief continued to advocate on social issues around the world, spending £1.5 million on pushing for social justice.  Our campaigns pushed the climate emergency to the fore, emphasising the need to cut harmful emissions and invest more in helping poor communities to adapt to global warming. Our own investment in this area was a spend of £27.5 million in projects responding to the climate emergency across 19 countries.  We also shone a spotlight on the plight of young people in poverty-stricken Gaza and Nepal through the publication of hard-hitting reports, and campaigned across 13 countries to highlight and tackle gender-based violence.  We offered a lifeline to those forced to flee their homes for safety.  As well as providing practical, lifesaving support to people uprooted from their homes, in 2020 Islamic Relief made sure decision-makers heard the voices of refugees in order to positively influence change.  We also helped tackle child trafficking and exploitation, supporting some of the world's most vulnerable children.   **We improved our governance structure**  2020 was also a pivotal year for our far-reaching governance reforms, which have been 6 years in the making.  We now have a larger Board of Trustees that is elected by a newly established International General Assembly whose members include representatives of our member offices across 5 continents.  **We warmly thank donors for their continued support, and for donating more generously than ever despite the difficult economic circumstances many have faced.**  **Read more about how your support has made a real difference for millions of vulnerable people across the globe in [Islamic Relief's Annual Report 2020]( ).**","['Cold Wave', 'Drought', 'Epidemic', 'Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Insect Infestation', 'Land Slide', 'Mud Slide', 'Other', 'Technological Disaster', 'Tropical Cyclone']","['Agriculture', 'Climate Change and Environment', 'Education', 'Food and Nutrition', 'Health', 'Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding', 'Protection and Human Rights', 'Recovery and Reconstruction', 'Shelter and Non-Food Items', 'Water Sanitation Hygiene']","['Afghanistan', 'Albania', 'Bangladesh', 'Bosnia and Herzegovina', 'Central African Republic', 'Chad', 'China', 'Ethiopia', 'Greece', 'Indonesia', 'Iraq', 'Jordan', 'Kenya', 'Lebanon', 'Malawi', 'Mali', 'Mozambique', 'Myanmar', 'Niger', 'occupied Palestinian territory', 'Pakistan', 'Philippines', 'Russian Federation', 'Serbia', 'Somalia', 'South Africa', 'South Sudan', 'Spain', 'Sudan', 'Syrian Arab Republic', 'the Republic of North Macedonia', 'Tunisia', 'United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland', 'World']",Other
3897111,"17 October 2022   New York    The situation in Ethiopia is spiraling out of control.       Violence and destruction have reached alarming levels.       The social fabric is being ripped apart.       Hostilities in the Tigray region of Ethiopia must end now ' including the immediate withdrawal and disengagement of Eritrean armed forces from Ethiopia.     There is no military solution.      Civilians are paying a horrific price.       Indiscriminate attacks -- including in residential areas -- are killing more innocent people every day, damaging critical infrastructure and limiting access to vital services.     Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes since hostilities resumed in August, many of them for the second time.      We are also hearing disturbing accounts of sexual violence and other acts of brutality against women, children and men.     All parties must adhere to their obligations under international humanitarian law.      Civilians must be protected ' and, so, too, humanitarian workers who are being attacked ' and even killed -- delivering lifesaving humanitarian aid.     The level of need is staggering.       Even before the resumption of hostilities, 13 million people required food and other support across Tigray, Amhara and Afar.      Deliveries of aid into Tigray have been suspended for more than seven weeks, and assistance to Amhara and Afar has also been disrupted.      All parties must allow and facilitate the rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for all civilians in need.     The United Nations is ready to support the African Union in every possible way to end this nightmare for the Ethiopian people.     We need the urgent resumption of talks towards an effective, lasting political settlement.       The international community must rally together now for peace in Ethiopia.      Thank you.     Q: James Bays, Al Jazeera. Could I first ask you on Ethiopia: You say there is no military solution, but the Ethiopian Government and the Eritrean forces believe they are close to victory.     And secondly, if I could ask you on Haiti: Why is an international force needed, and are you close to getting countries coming forward, stepping up to provide such a force?     SG: First of all, the problem with wars is when both sides think they can win the war. And we have had episodes in which both sides have affirmed that conviction. My belief is that there is really no military solution. And it's important to think about the need to reconcile the communities that have been so dramatically impacted by this war.     Now, in relation to Haiti, we live in an absolutely dramatic situation. We have the harbor blocked by gangs, not allowing fuel and other needed materials to move.  We have, because of that, no fuel in the city.  Where there is no fuel, there is no water. And we have an outbreak of cholera, and you know that the treatment for cholera, the most important treatment is hydration, and there is no water available in the city. So it's an absolutely nightmarish situation for the population of Haiti, especially Port-au-Prince.  That is the reason why twice I referred in informal meetings to the Security Council and formally through a report, a letter I presented, that I believe that we need not only to strengthen the police, strengthening it with training, with equipment, with a number of other measures, but that, in the present circumstances, we need an armed action to release the port and to allow for a humanitarian corridor to be established. I am talking about something to be done in support of the Haitian police and I am talking of something to be done based on strict humanitarian criteria, independent of the political dimensions of the problem that need to be solved by the Haitians themselves.     Q: Thank you. Sherwin Bryce-Pease, South Africa Broadcasting Company. Secretary-General, there are two issues in the Security Council. There is an argument that says this is an internal matter and sovereignty needs to be respected, and then there is also the space to allow the African processes to play itself out here.      Is it time for the Security Council to take a more active role in terms of sanctioning members of resolutions that, for example, as it pertains to what happens in Ethiopia?     SG: You are referring to which of these…?     Q: To the situation in Ethiopia. There has been an argument that this is an internal matter, and that the Council does not have any purview, given its role in terms of International Peace and Security, and also to give the Africans the space to solve their own problems; is it time for greater action from the Council?      SG: I do believe that this conflict, which essentially was born as an internal conflict, today has an international dimension. You have Eritrean forces inside Ethiopia; you have a delicate situation on the border with Sudan; so this is something that needs to be seriously considered by all entities, including the Security Council.     Thank you very much.     Q: Mr. Secretary-General, when you say there should be armed action, you said that there should be an armed action in Haiti. Who should carry that out? Have you heard, have you gotten any offers?      SG: That is for the Security Council and Member States to decide.      Q: Do you believe that the conflict in Ukraine takes all the attention from other world problems, like Ethiopia, and why do they have to compete for the attention of tragedies? Why do you think?      SG: I think we need to pay attention to all conflicts where people are suffering. We need to pay a lot of attention necessarily to the crisis in Ukraine that is of global dimension, but we can not forget crises like the Ethiopian one, where the level of suffering and the people, the number of casualties are absolutely gigantic.",['Epidemic'],"['Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding', 'Protection and Human Rights']","['Ethiopia', 'Haiti']",News and Press Release

1459521,"DSG/SM/953-ENV/DEV/1646  Following are UN Deputy Secretary-General Jan Eliasson's remarks, as prepared for delivery, at an event marking the first anniversary of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and World Tsunami Awareness Day, in New York today:  Today, we mark a year since the world adopted the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.  Today, we also raise awareness of our first commemoration of World Tsunami Awareness Day.   The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction of last year reaffirms the importance of disaster risk reduction.  The aim is to respond effectively when disasters strike and build back better in the recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction phases.  There is no starker, more poignant illustration of the importance of disaster risk reduction than tsunamis.  We saw them in southern Asia in 2004 and in Japan five years ago.  Looking back at these disasters, it is evident that we can significantly reduce the risk that they pose.  With investments in early warning systems, shelters, urban planning, building codes and a well-informed population, we can save many thousands of lives and much-needed resources.  An innovative cyclone shelter programme and the creation of a community-based early warning programme have helped Bangladesh dramatically reduce cyclone mortality since the 1970s.  In the past four decades, the country has been struck by three severe cyclones:  Bhola, Gorky and Sidr.  Bhola caused an estimated 300,000 deaths and Gorky was responsible for more than 138,000, while the death toll of Sidr was 'only' around 4,000.  I thank the Government of Japan [for] showing such valuable global leadership on this important issue and for supporting World Tsunami Day.  We must now continue the work that started in Sendai.  Preparations are now under way for the World Humanitarian Summit in May.  This is a critically important opportunity for world leaders to come together and address humanitarian assistance — both for man-made and natural disasters.    As we carry this work forward, we are building on the solid foundation of the Sendai Framework and all the important agreements reached last year.  Above all, we are carrying out these plans to see real results so that the world can live up to our promise to leave no one behind.  In closing, I wish to reiterate the Secretary-General's words:  'Sustainability starts in Sendai.'  Let us always remember this prime point as we advance towards a more sustainable future where all people can live in dignity, safety and peace.  Thank you.  *For information media.

Compounded by the political volatility, economic deterioration, the residual impact of COVID-19 and the protracted nutrition emergency, with high rates of global acute malnutrition (on average 23 per cent in the districts most affected by floods), children have been pushed to the brink. During the monsoon season, rainfall was equivalent to nearly 2.9 times the national 30-year average, causing widespread flooding and landslides with severe repercussions for human lives, property, and infrastructure. An estimated 20.6 million people, including 9.6 million children, need humanitarian assistance. To date, 94 districts have been declared 'calamity hit' by the Government of Pakistan. Many of the hardest-hit districts are amongst the most vulnerable districts in Pakistan, where children already suffer from high malnutrition, poor access to water and sanitation, low school enrolment, and other deprivations.  In mountainous and high altitude areas of Pakistan, many also affected by the floods, have received snowfall and temperatures have fallen below 0 Celsius, particularly in the northern and northwestern parts of Pakistan including Khyber Pakhtunkwa (KP), Gilgit Baltistan (GB), Pakistan Administered Kashmir (PAK) and northern Balochistan. The coldest place in Pakistan usually are the glacial parts of GB, where in winters the average temperature remains below -20.

3710350,"4 February, Mogadishu: Save the Children is deeply concerned by the deteriorating humanitarian situation for hundreds of thousands of children under five in Somalia, as the country reels from a second and potentially deadlier wave of desert locusts[[1]]( ), an uptick in violence, and the ongoing impact of COVID-19. The situation has become so dire the [Agriculture Ministry]( ) declared a state of emergency on Wednesday.  [New figures released today]( ) reveal up to 2.7 million people in Somalia face acute food shortages ([IPC Phase 3]( ) or worse) through mid-2021, including approximately 839 000 children under five likely to be acutely malnourished. Of this number, 143,000 children are likely to be severely malnourished, requiring urgent medical treatment to survive.  These disturbing figures are suspected to be the result of a combination of the resurgent swarms of desert locusts, the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing conflict, and climate shocks including drought and floods.  Save the Children is warning that without an urgent injection of funds into humanitarian programs, thousands of children's lives will be at risk.  Somalia was already one of the least prepared countries on earth for the impacts of a pandemic, ranked bottom on the [2019 Global Health Security Index]( ) in its vulnerability to biological threats. While the official death count from COVID-19 stands at 132[[2]]( ), nearly non-existent testing means the true impact may never be known. The pandemic has obliterated the country's economic base of [diaspora remittances]( 's%20economic%20recovery.&text=A%20slowdown%20in%20economic%20activities,virus%20are%20reducing%20household%20income.), as well as impacting livestock sales, another economic bedrock.  Weather predictions point towards a second consecutive season of below-average rainfall from March to May due to the La Niña effect, which may push already-desperate families to the brink of starvation.

3898861,"*Cases of malnutrition escalate rapidly as the lives of millions of children remain in jeopardy*  **ISLAMABAD, 21 October 2022** — In the aftermath of the devastating floods in Pakistan, health facilities are reporting alarming levels of severe acute malnutrition among children in affected areas, UNICEF warned today. More than 1 in 9 children under five admitted to health facilities in flood-affected areas of Sindh and Balochistan were found to be suffering from severe acute malnutrition.  In total, of the over 22,000 children screened by health professionals since September 2022 at health facilities in flood-affected regions, more than 2,630 were diagnosed with severe acute malnutrition, or more than 1 in 9 children. Severe acute malnutrition, also known as severe wasting, is a life-threatening condition where children are too thin for their height, resulting in weakened immune systems.  Estimates based on the pre-existing malnutrition prevalence of the latest National Nutrition Survey indicate that close to 1.6 million children could be suffering from severe acute malnutrition and in need of urgent treatment in flood-affected areas of Sindh and Balochistan provinces. Malnourished pregnant women are also at risk of giving birth to low birthweight babies who will be malnourished.    'We cannot sound this alarm loudly enough,' said Abdullah Fadil, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan. 'We are facing a nutrition emergency that is threatening the lives of millions of children. Without urgent action, we are heading towards a catastrophic outcome that is threatening children's very development and survival. We are grateful for the global community's support so far, but much more is needed to save children's lives.'   Even before the devastating floods, half of the children living in the now flood-affected districts were already stunted — an irreversible condition that stunts the growth, physical and cognitive development of children. Likewise, more than 40 per cent of mothers suffered from anaemia. Over 25 million children and women across Pakistan, including more than 7 million children and women in flood-affected areas, require immediate access to essential nutrition services.  UNICEF is on the ground, delivering life-saving nutrition services, including the provision of ready-to-use therapeutic food supplies to children suffering from severe acute malnutrition. Together with the Government of Pakistan, the World Food Programme, and other partners, UNICEF has established 271 outpatient therapeutic treatment centres for the prevention, detection and treatment of cases of severe acute malnutrition and other forms of malnutrition. UNICEF is also working to expand nutrition services through 73 mobile health teams in the 84 flood-affected districts, coupled with health, water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and protection services that are critical to save children's lives.  The lack of safe drinking water and hygiene increases the risk of wasting, as unsafe water can cause diarrhoea and prevent children from getting the nutrients they need to survive. Over 5 million people no longer have safe drinking water sources and more than 6 million no longer have home sanitation facilities. As a result, the percentage of people practising open defecation has increased from one-fifth before the floods, to over one-third of the affected population. At the same time, water-borne illnesses are quickly spreading among children and families and cases of acute watery diarrhoea, malaria, dengue fever, skin conditions, respiratory infections and other diseases are also sharply rising.  In response, UNICEF is delivering 2 million litres of safe drinking water every day, rehabilitating water systems, distributing hygiene kits and providing sanitation and hygiene services.  UNICEF has revised its appeal to US$175.3 million, of which US$35 million will go towards lifesaving nutrition services and US$58 million towards essential WASH services. Only 13 per cent of UNICEF's appeal for the children and families of Pakistan has been funded.  **UNICEF is calling for:**  - Support from the international community in order to reach over 7 million children, adolescent girls and women who are in need of nutrition services, over 5 million people who are in need of safe drinking water, and over 6 million who are in need of sanitation services.  - Integration of nutrition into government health delivery services and increased allocation of government funding for nutrition in the long term.   **Media contacts**   Catherine Weibel     UNICEF Pakistan   Tel: +92 300 500 2595   Email:      Joe English   UNICEF New York   Tel: +1 917 893 0692   Email:      [View all contacts]( )  **Multimedia content**  [Pakistan.

3809094,"*CARE: 'Mothers last ones to eat, children first ones to freeze'*  Syrians, fleeing over a decade of war in their homeland, have found their situation exacerbated following the onslaught of heavy winter storms. In Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, temperatures are expected to drop lower than they have in 40 years, reaching -14 degrees and lower. Strong winds reaching up to 80km/h, coupled with heavy hail and snow in mountainous areas are endangering the lives of millions of people living in already precarious circumstances.   'This is yet another blow to people whose lives are already beyond unbearable. People can see their own breath when lying on their thin mattresses; you will see children walk around in flip-flops and ripped shirts. Families are afraid that they will freeze to death,' says Jolien Veldwijk, CARE Syria Country Director.   In Syria, over 6.7 million people have been internally displaced, while another 6.8 live as refugees in neighboring countries such as Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. Most displaced people found shelter in tents, unfinished buildings, and sheds, leaving them particularly vulnerable to harsh winter conditions. 'With extremely low temperatures in Jordan at the moment and the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, winter assistance is more crucial than ever to help the most vulnerable refugees keep a roof over their heads and their families safe from the cold,' comments Ammar Abu Zayyad, CARE Jordan Country Director.  In Lebanon, refugees live across hundreds of informal settlements, lacking adequate protection. 'People don't have jobs or incomes, no access to jobs. They are already suffering consequences of an unprecedented economic crisis in Lebanon and have no means to protect themselves against the expected snowstorms,' says Bujar Hoxha, CARE Lebanon Country Director.  'CARE is particularly concerned about the situation of displaced people inside Syria, especially women and children. Deteriorating shelter conditions, limited fuel supply, and the use of hazardous materials to stay warm, are giving rise to grave health and environmental impacts. During the cold winter, mothers are usually the last ones to eat, and children are usually the first ones to freeze,' says Sherine Ibrahim, CARE Turkey's Country Director.  CARE's teams across the region have been able to help many with winterization support, including more than 86,000 people in Syria and 4,000 people in Jordan. Across Syria and the region, CARE is supporting displaced people with insulating their tents, strengthening makeshift shelters, and distributing warm clothing, blankets, and cash. Cash is particularly important for people living in informal tent settlements to afford fuel for heating, as they are most affected by the cold.  'This crisis response remains severely underfunded. This year, we've only received a fraction of the funding needed to prepare people for the winter and protect them against the cold. Only 46% of the funding needed to support Syrians is currently available. The conflict in Syria has been ongoing for almost eleven years, and we are afraid donors are growing tired of funding humanitarian assistance. Unfortunately, the needs have only increased over the past years, and right now we can see people fearing to freeze to death because desperately needed funding is unavailable', says Jolien Veldwijk.   While snowfall and sub-zero temperatures are not unusual in the Middle East, climate change has caused increased flooding and rainfall. 'Flash floods are simply washing away the tents and the few belongings people were able to take when their houses were bombed. The winters are getting harsher and deadlier, while families are less and less able to cope with freezing temperatures,' says Veldwijik.","['Cold Wave', 'Flash Flood']","['Protection and Human Rights', 'Shelter and Non-Food Items']","['Jordan', 'Lebanon', 'Syrian Arab Republic']",News and Press Release
3743898,"According to statistics from the Vietnam Disaster Management Agency, over the past 20 years, the northern mountainous provinces have experienced more than 300 flash floods, mud and rock floods with an increasingly large scale and scope, causing a lot of damage on people, property and infrastructure. To prevent, avoid and limit damage caused by flash floods and landslides, forecasting and early warning plays a very important role.  **Flash floods and landslides are becoming more and more complicated**  Cao Bang is one of the northern mountainous provinces with mountainous terrain, high slopes, and often suffers from natural disasters such as hail, tornadoes, flash floods, landslides... causing a lot of damage. According to the Commanding Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control and Search and Rescue of Cao Bang Province, in 2020, natural disasters caused nearly VND 80 billion in damage and claimed three lives. In which, floods, flash floods, landslides occurred in all 10/10 districts and cities in the province, affected more than 6,000 houses. Many traffic works, schools, cultural houses, hospitals, irrigation works, clean water were damaged.  In Yen Bai, statistics show that the whole province currently has 1,166 locations where flash floods and landslides are frequent. Specifically, there are 682.44 km2 with high risk of flash floods; 182.4 km2 has a very high risk of landslides and 144.6 km2 is at high risk, so it is very important to require early warning of flash floods and landslides.  In Dien Bien province, in the past three years (2018 - 2020), there hasn't been a year without heavy damage to people and property caused by floods, flash floods and landslides. According to Dien Bien Provincial Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control and Search and Rescue, in 2020, natural disasters in Dien Bien killed four people and injured six; 3,849 houses were damaged or collapsed; 2,500 ha of rice, crops and nearly 100 irrigation works, bridges, schools were damaged… total damage was over 263 billion VND. According to Deputy Chief of the Office of the Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control and Search and Rescue of Dien Bien Province, Nguyen Duc Dang, despite actively propagandizing and warning about the risk of floods and flash floods in localities, natural disasters are becoming more and more severe and extremely unpredictable.  An increase in the density and intensity of landslides, rockslides and flash floods was also recorded in Lao Cai province. Data from the Commanding Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control and Search and Rescue in Lao Cai province said that in the past 10 years, Lao Cai has had 59 heavy rains; 27 flash floods, landslides along with many other types of natural disasters, killing 226 people, eight people went missing; 229 people were injured... Economic damage is estimated at more than 4,624 billion VND, an average of 400 to 500 billion VND/year.  **Enhance warning capacity**  According to the Vietnam Disaster Managemnet Agency, in recent years, the northern mountainous provinces are often affected by local heavy rains, causing flash floods, landslides, serious damage to life and property of people. Therefore, in order to actively respond to this type of disaster, along with the need to develop a system of warning maps and disaster maps, maps of evacuation locations, the appropriate development and use of real-time monitoring and early warning systems is essential. Sharing about the existing flash flood and landslide warning system in the northern mountainous region, Dr. Le Quang Tuan, Deputy Director of the Department of Science, Technology and International Cooperation, Vietnam Disaster Managemnet Agency said that developing early warning systems is very important and is the most proactive solution to reduce disaster risk. The forecasting and warning work has made certain progress, the national forecasting agency has issued forecast bulletins to the district level, regularly updating and supplementing the situation of natural disasters to serve the work of the directing the response; a specialized warning and monitoring system with the application of many prevention solutions, but there seems to be no effective solution to stop or minimize the impact and damage caused by flash floods and landslides.  Recorded in Lao Cai province, there are currently nine hydrometeorological stations; 53 automatic rain gauge stations; three natural disaster early warning systems are invested from domestic capital, while the disaster warning systems of Korea, the mud and rock flood warning station of Taiwan (China) are running trials... but Due to the complex terrain, scattered population, plus limited funding, the investment and installation of equipment and disaster early warning systems are only prioritized for key places...  In Cao Bang province, Deputy Director of the Sub-Department, in charge of the Sub-Department of Irrigation Ma Thi Huyen Linh, said that in order to gradually overcome limitations in disaster warning work for people to know and take the initiative in natural disaster prevention and control to meet practical requirements, the Provincial People's Committee needs to provide additional support  about 90 million VND/year (operating and maintenance costs) for monitoring stations to operate to perform disaster warning tasks.  Lack of funding has been affecting the capacity to warn of flash floods and landslides in the northern mountainous provinces. However, in addition to financial difficulties, many provinces also face the shortage and unprofessionalism of natural disaster prevention and control forces. In many localities, instead of arranging full-time officers, this force is mainly part-time, leading to most of the staff not having basic training in disaster prevention and control, so it is difficult to deploy coordination between all levels and sectors in the locality. Along with that, the investment in equipping more facilities and tools to support the improvement of disaster prevention capacity at all levels, strengthening the activities of disaster prevention and control teams at commune, village and hamlet levels to proactively respond and rescue according to the ""four on the spot"" motto is still limited.  According to Deputy Chief of the Office of the Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control of Dien Bien Province Nguyen Duc Dang, to improve the warning capacity of flash floods and landslides, in 2020, the Provincial People's Committee has allocated 610 million VND to install equipment to serve the activities of the Provincial Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control; urged units to donate more than 20 billion VND to the disaster prevention and control fund; organized training to improve the capacity of forecasting and responding to natural disasters for nearly 1,500 people who are the people, officials, civil servants and the armed forces.  According to Dr. Le Quang Tuan, it is necessary to develop a real-time disaster warning system, based on continuous monitoring data, this requires a huge investment and needs to combine all four groups of solutions. including: Developing and using an early warning system associated with an online map of zoning risks and disasters of flash floods, landslides, etc., with clear running paths and safe shelters. on the map for people; promoting education, communication, training and drills for local authorities and people (hamlets, villages and communes) on the use of maps and early warning systems; including educational content on skills to recognize and respond to flash floods and landslides into primary education curricula in mountainous areas. Socializing investment resources, managing operations, subscribing to warning information about flash floods and landslides; strengthening guidance and mobilizing people to install and use people's rain gauge stations to forecast and warn about the possibility of imminent flash floods and landslides. Finally, the Government and authorities at all levels need to pay more attention to investing and implementing large-scale projects and schemes in order to develop a real-time monitoring and early warning system at national scale, smooth online connection from the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control to local authorities at all levels.

1579486,"**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS**  Each year disasters have a major impact on children, youth and education systems. In the disaster-prone region of the Asia Pacific, around 200 million children per year will have their lives severely disrupted by disasters in the coming decades. Every child has a right to a quality education, yet across the region many children are unable to realise this right due to the impact of these disasters. Educational inequities are made worse because of schools being damaged or destroyed (due to poor site selection, design, or construction), schools being used as evacuation centres, and because disaster risk reduction (DRR) policies are not being adequately resourced or prioritised through different levels of governments and to the community level. Being unable to realise this right puts children at risk of exploitation and violence, and contributes towards a lack of economic participation.   Furthermore, if education is supported before, during and after a disaster it can save lives, protect children and benefit whole communities and countries. Schools can have a catalytic effect on strengthening humanitarian effectiveness, reducing vulnerabilities and supporting risk mitigation for future hazards. Additionally, while the cost of education in emergencies interventions can be high, such costs can be minimised with investment to ensure that national education systems are less vulnerable, and local schools are better prepared to bounce back from crisis and return children to learning as soon as possible.   This report seeks to shine a light on the continuing impact that disasters have on education by profiling five specific events that struck the Asia-Pacific region in 2015 ' the earthquakes in Nepal, floods in Indonesia and Myanmar, Typhoon Koppu in the Philippines, and Cyclone Pam in Vanuatu. Some of the profiles are of large disasters such as that in Nepal, while others are recurring disasters that force children out of school on an annual or semi-annual basis, such as the typhoons in the Philippines or floods in Indonesia. Many of these are not identified as major disasters by any national or international declaration. The country profiles reveal that:  ' Regardless of the size of the disaster, education was still disrupted. In countries such as Nepal where the earthquakes caused large-scale disruption, many children lost months of education. In Indonesia or the Philippines where the disaster was much smaller in scale, children were generally out of school for shorter periods of time.   However, countries such as Philippines, Indonesia and Myanmar often experience similar disasters every year and thus children regularly lose school days, thus compounding the negative impact on their education over their whole school experience.  ' Pre-existing challenges with school enrolment, alongside the damage to education infrastructure, often leave many children in need of critical education support to help ensure their longer-term development.  ' Education is generally not prioritised in a disaster response, and reconstruction or rehabilitation of damaged schools is often belated. Almost a year after the earthquakes in Nepal and Cyclone Pam in Vanuatu, children are still being taught in temporary learning centres that were meant for use for weeks or months, not years.  ' There are significant gaps in information from the education sector on both the short- and long-term impact disasters have on education. A lack of official data collection and analysis on the number of children and schools affected by disasters is reported as often inhibiting coordination amongst response agencies, government bodies and community organisations, and on the effectiveness of the education response as a whole.  ' The differing levels of both policy commitments and actual implementation of DRR in the education sector at all levels, and the limited resources available to ensure the construction of safe schools, made a significant difference to the negative impact the disasters had on educational continuity across the five profiled countries.   A positive example of DRR in education reducing the impact of disasters on education was with Typhoon Koppu in the Philippines where fewer children were forced out of school for substantial periods due to the emphasis on integrating DRR into education from the national level all the way to the school and community level.   There were clear differences between countries and within the different districts affected by the disasters due to the resources and capacity available at the local level Ministry of Education (MoE) to ensure risks were reduced prior to the disaster occurring, and education was prioritised in the disaster response.   Countries such as Indonesia and Myanmar that experience small-scale flooding each year struggle to receive sufficient funding to ensure wide-spread safe school construction; capacity building of teachers, local government staff and community members in DRR; and resilience education of students to ensure that they have greater awareness of the risks and potential impacts of disasters coupled with basic training on what to do during a disaster prior to a disaster occurring.  ' Standardisation is often lacking across national and sub-national levels in the planning and development of comprehensive school safety policies and DRR-related strategies, initiatives and plans that exist in the education sector.   The country profiles also demonstrated that the need to mitigate the wide range of risks to children's safety and survival in school, and threats to educational continuity, requires a pro-active approach. Safeguarding education requires a thorough analysis of known and expected hazards and risks, action to reduce these, and planning for educational continuity. The consistent provision of safe and quality education is vital to the success of sustainable development objectives, and significantly speeds recovery from shocks and stresses.   As part of its regional initiative 'Education Safe from Disasters', Save the Children's ambition is for zero children killed or injured in schools and zero days of schooling lost when a disaster strikes in Asia and the Pacific. However, we cannot achieve this without increased prioritisation, funding and focus on understanding the impacts of disasters on education, risk reduction, preparedness and response for the education sector from humanitarian and development agencies, donors, national governments and regional bodies. To achieve this goal and ensure communities and countries both benefit from the provision of a safe and quality education for all children, we recommend:  *National Governments*  ' Become a Safe School leader by signing onto the Worldwide Initiative for Safe Schools in support of the implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.  ' Ensure policy and legal frameworks for a comprehensive approach to disaster risk reduction in the education sector are in place. Such frameworks are an important foundation for integrating risk reduction and resilience into education sector strategies, policies and plans.  ' Identify national priorities for investment and support for disaster risk reduction in the education sector.  ' Adopt an evidence-based child-centred approach to education sector risk reduction, putting children's safety and wellbeing at the centre of national, sub-national and local levels efforts.  ' Establish organisational arrangements for leadership and coordination for risk reduction and resilience including trained and supported focal points at all levels of administration and at school-community level.  ' Ensure the Education Information Management Systems (EIMS) are systematically recording data on the impact of disasters on education for use in risk reduction and response planning.  ' Investigate and document the short- and long-term impacts of disasters on primary and secondary education. Such studies can identify policy, implementation, data and knowledge gaps that will provide an evidence base to inform program and advocacy strategies, as well as seeking to put some more comprehensive numbers behind the stories of the impacts of disasters.  *Donors*  ' Financially invest in and politically commit to support 'Education Cannot Wait: the Fund for Education in Emergencies'. This fund aims to unite global and national actors to generate the shared political, operational and financial commitment needed to meet the education needs of the millions of children and young people affected by crises. The platform seeks to inspire political commitment, generate and disburse new funding, strengthen planning and response, increase capacity and improve accountability.   It has the potential to be the game-changer that is needed to tackle the chronic problem of underresourcing of education in humanitarian crises.  ' Increase investment in understanding risks, disaster risk reduction, and response-preparedness in the education sector. The risks to children's education will be greatly reduced if national education systems are able to take a comprehensive approach to ensure safe school facilities, school disaster management (including educational continuity planning) and risk reduction and resilience education.  *Regional and Global Platforms*  ' Articulate goals, commitments and collaborate initiatives for comprehensive school safety at the regional level.  ' Support national governments' capacity-building, knowledge exchange and technical expertise, and promote sustainable, scalable and quality-tested approaches, and standardised monitoring across countries.    *Humanitarian and Development Partners*  ' Support the implementation of nationally defined priorities for risk reduction in the education sector.  ' Collect and share evidence-base approaches to risk reduction in education sector programming.  ' Engage in national, regional and international coordination mechanisms to avoid duplication of efforts or wasteful development of tools and materials which have been developed and tested by other partners.","['Earthquake', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Storm Surge', 'Tropical Cyclone']","['Disaster Management', 'Education']","['Indonesia', 'Myanmar', 'Nepal', 'Philippines', 'Vanuatu', 'World']",Analysis
3799486,"**Save the Children says child-friendly early warning system could have saved their lives**  **Jakarta, 10 December** -- Seven children were among the 43 people killed by the eruption of Indonesia's Mount Semeru volcano on Saturday, Save the Children said today. Four of the seven children were primary-school age, and the rest were at junior high schools[[i]][i].   Save the Children said the deaths of the children could have been avoided if child-friendly early warning systems had been in place, such as plain language signs with pictures in schools and other places where children will see them. The agency said that the absence of such systems may have contributed to the children being unable to flee to safety before the eruption reached them.   Wiwied Trisnadi, Senior Humanitarian Manager at Save the Children in Indonesia, said:   **""We are deeply saddened to learn of the deaths of these seven children, who were not able to evacuate to safety in time. It is alarming that in Indonesia, a country prone to volcanic eruptions, tsunamis and earthquakes, there are not child-friendly early warning systems available to help children better understand and respond to the hazards around them"".**  Save the Children is urging the Indonesian government to establish child-friendly warning systems in areas at high risk of volcanic eruption, and to ensure children are educated about how to use them.   In Indonesia, disaster alerts are issued via a mobile-phone application, but many people in disaster-prone areas still do not have access to mobile technology and rely on outdated warning systems like the bashing of bamboo sticks to alert people of the need to evacuate.    Thousands of homes were destroyed after smouldering hot ash from the eruption buried villages near the volcano. Thousands of people were displaced and [22 people are still missing]( ), according to emergency responders, who are still digging through thick layers of ash and debris to find survivors.    Local people reported that the volcanic eruption was so large that it blocked out the sun, temporarily leaving surrounding districts in complete darkness. Rain has since triggered volcanic mud slides, which has made an already difficult disaster response still more challenging.   Together with a coalition of NGOs, Save the Children Indonesia is will conduct a Joint Needs Assessment for impacted children and their families, covering education child protection, health and nutrition and food security and livelihoods.

1569351,"<h2>Agile, resilient and sustainable supply chains for children</h2>   **Improving accessibility, bridging financial gaps, generating savings and strengthening supply chains with governments**   or 70 years, securing the health and wellbeing of children around the world has been at the heart of everything UNICEF says and does.   Between 2000 and 2015, the global community made great strides to improve the lives of children and their families ' galvanized by the common objectives of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).   The collective commitment of governments, donors, partners and international institutions more than halved under-five mortality rates since 2000 (from 12.7 million to 5.9 million children); contributed to an almost 50 per cent fall in extreme poverty (from 1.9 billion to 836 million); provided access to water for 2.6 billion people; and helped 43 million additional children attend primary school each year ' many of these are girls. But there is more yet to do.   In September 2015, world leaders committed to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a renewed global push, between now and 2030, to end extreme poverty, fight inequality and injustice and address climate change. The 17 SDGs include goals that are specific to the health and wellbeing of children and adolescents. Access to affordable, high-quality vaccines, medicines, water and sanitation and education supplies is critical to realizing the SDGs.   UNICEF remains one of the largest buyers of supplies for children and in 2015 procured over $3.4 billion in supplies and services. At the same time, UNICEF Supply responded to increased requests from governments for technical expertise, knowledge sharing and collaboration to optimize supply chains, prevent stock-outs, reduce costs and ensure timely delivery. UNICEF uses evidencebased strategies that focus on competition, transparency, special financing, special contracting and partner collaboration to tackle market issues to achieve value for money, sustainability and meet demand.   These efforts contributed to increased availability and declining prices in 2015:   Over $422.8 million in savings and cost avoidance was achieved in 14 commodity groups across the year, bringing cumulative savings since 2012 to $1.068 billion.   The rapidly growing supply financing area of UNICEF's work is core to achieving the above and is the theme of this year's annual report. Initially, UNICEF's support in this area focused on securing bridge financing for countries experiencing gaps in the timely availability of funds to buy supplies. However, in the last five years, the work on supply financing solutions for children has expanded markedly. It covers special contracting arrangements that help address market uncertainties and contribute to lower prices; technical support to build countries' budgeting, financing and procurement self-sufficiency; and efforts to encourage expansion of the local supplierbase. The report explains each of these financing interventions, and through country examples, illustrates the impact of these efforts on the lives of children.   Alongside efforts to establish agile, resilient supply chains, UNICEF Supply continued to respond to the needs of children caught in crisis and conflict throughout 2015. The Supply emergency response reached children in Burundi, the Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Guinea, Iraq, Liberia, Malawi, Nepal, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Syria and Vanuatu. UNICEF Supply also supported migrant and refugee children risking their lives to find safety and education in Europe.      Despite this varying and often challenging operational environment, achievements across the year demonstrate the scope and value of UNICEF Supply and its potential to contribute to global efforts to ensure children and young people are healthy, safe, educated and empowered. The drive to integrate sustainability into supply chains for children is built upon ingenuity, perseverance and compassion ' qualities that define UNICEF colleagues who procure and deliver supplies that help fulfil every child's right to a full and healthy life.","['Drought', 'Earthquake', 'Epidemic', 'Flood', 'Other', 'Storm Surge', 'Tropical Cyclone']","['Coordination', 'Education', 'Food and Nutrition', 'Health', 'HIV/Aids', 'Logistics and Telecommunications', 'Shelter and Non-Food Items', 'Water Sanitation Hygiene']","['Albania', 'Burundi', 'Central African Republic', 'Croatia', 'Ethiopia', 'Guinea', 'Iraq', 'Jordan', 'Kenya', 'Lebanon', 'Liberia', 'Malawi', 'Nepal', 'Nigeria', 'Serbia', 'Sierra Leone', 'South Sudan', 'Syrian Arab Republic', 'the Republic of North Macedonia', 'Türkiye', 'Ukraine', 'Vanuatu', 'World', 'Yemen']",Other
3761131,"Lebanese authorities have spent the past year shamelessly obstructing victims' quest for truth and justice following the catastrophic port explosion in Beirut, said Amnesty International ahead of the one-year anniversary of the blast.  More than 217 people were killed and 7,000 injured when 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate exploded in Beirut's port on 4 August 2020. The blast displaced 300,000 people and caused widespread destruction and devastation, damaging buildings up to 20km away.   Throughout the year, the Lebanese authorities' relentless efforts to shield officials from scrutiny have repeatedly hampered the course of the investigation. Authorities dismissed the first judge appointed to the investigation after he summoned political figures for questioning, and have so far rejected the new investigative judge's requests to lift MPs' immunity and to question senior members of the security forces in connection with the tragedy.    'The Beirut blast, one of the largest non-nuclear explosions in history, inflicted widespread devastation and caused immense suffering. Lebanese authorities promised a swift investigation; instead they have brazenly blocked and stalled justice at every turn, despite a tireless campaign for justice and criminal accountability by survivors and families of victims,' said Lynn Maalouf, Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International.    'The Lebanese government tragically failed to protect the lives of its people, just as it has failed for so long to protect basic socio-economic rights. In blocking the judge's attempts to summon political officials, the authorities have struck yet another blow to the people of Lebanon. Given the scale of this tragedy, it is astounding to see how far the Lebanese authorities are prepared to go to shield themselves from scrutiny.'   As the first anniversary of the blast approaches, deeply traumatized residents of Beirut are still reeling from its catastrophic impact.   Mireille Khoury, whose 15-year-old son Elias died of injuries sustained in the explosion, described the horrific events of that day to Amnesty International:    'The day of 4 August seemed like the end of the world. We thought it was just a fire… I passed out and then woke up to find my house in ruins. My daughter asked me what happened. She was injured and I was injured too. I rushed outside and found my son on the staircase injured and covered with blood… On that day, they ruined our lives,' she said    'If Lebanese authorities allow this crime to pass without accountability, they will go down in history in the most horrendous manner,' she said, adding that she believes an international investigation is the only means to deliver justice.    Leaked official documents indicate that Lebanese customs, military and security authorities, as well as the judiciary, had warned successive governments of the dangerous stockpile of explosive chemicals at the port on at least 10 occasions in the past six years, yet no action was taken. The President also stated that he had knowledge of the danger but had 'left it to the port authorities to address.'    Despite this, MPs and officials have been claiming their right to immunity throughout the investigation. This tactic has been used repeatedly in a decades-long context of post-conflict amnesty in Lebanon, effectively shielding suspected perpetrators of serious crimes under international law, and denying thousands of victims any form of acknowledgment, let alone justice.   **Obstruction of justice**    On 10 December 2020, Judge Fadi Sawan, the first investigative judge appointed, charged former Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil, former Public Works ministers Youssef Fenianos and Ghazi Zeaiter, and caretaker Prime Minister Hassan Diab, with criminal 'negligence.' All refused to appear before the judge. Hassan Diab decried the decision as a violation of the constitution. Ghazi Zeaiter and Ali Hassan Khalil filed a lawsuit with the Court of Cassation to remove Judge Sawan from the investigation, citing immunity for MPs from criminal prosecution.    In response, Judge Sawan suspended the investigation on 17 December 2020 for nearly two months. Shortly afterwards on 18 February 2021, Lebanon's Court of Cassation dismissed Judge Sawan. The decision to remove Judge Sawan was received with great anger by the families of victims, who took to the streets condemning political interference in the probe.   On 2 July 2021, the new judge assigned to the case, Judge Tarek Bitar, submitted a request to parliament to lift parliamentary immunity for MPs Ali Hasan Khalil, Ghazi Zeaiter and Nouhad Machnouk, along with several other high-ranking officials.    In response, 26 MPs from the blocs of Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, Amal Movement, Hezbollah, and Future Movement, signed a petition requesting the launch of a parallel proceedings in an attempt to avoid interrogation by Judge Bitar. Six MPs later withdrew their signatures, following the outcry on social media from victims' families and civil society activists.    In a separate move, the Minister of Interior rejected a request by Judge Bitar to question the head of General Security, Abbas Ibrahim, one of the country's top generals. The judge is appealing the decision. In recent more positive moves, both the Beirut and Tripoli bar associations have lifted immunities from officials who are also lawyers ' but parliamentary immunities, to date, remain in place.    Granting immunity to political officials directly contradicts Lebanon's obligations under the UN 2016 Minnesota Protocol which aims to protect the right to life and advance justice, accountability for unlawful deaths. The protocol identifies a potentially unlawful death as occurring 'where the State may have failed to meet its obligations to protect life'. In such cases, states have a duty to hold perpetrators accountable, and impunity stemming from 'political interference' or 'blanket amnesties' directly contradicts that duty.    Amnesty International stands with families of victims in calling on Lebanese authorities to immediately lift all immunities granted to officials, regardless of their role or position.   In June, Amnesty International [wrote to the UN Human Rights Council]( ) with a coalition of over 50 Lebanese and international organizations, calling for an international investigative mission, such as a one-year fact-finding mission, into the Beirut blast. The letter highlighted the procedural and systemic flaws which prevent Lebanonfrom meeting its international obligations to provide redress to victims.   'The weeks of protests by survivors and families of victims are a stark reminder of what is at stake. Their pain and anger have been exacerbated as, time and time again, authorities obstruct their right to truth and justice,' said Lynn Maalouf.   'The UN Human Rights Council must heed their call and urgently set up an investigative mechanism to identifywhether conduct by the state caused or contributed to the unlawful deaths,and what steps need to be taken to ensure an effective remedy to victims.""",['Technological Disaster'],['Protection and Human Rights'],['Lebanon'],News and Press Release

3913814,"**I. Introduction**  1\. The present report is submitted pursuant to Security Council resolution [2636 (2022)]( (2022)), by which the Council decided to extend the mandate of the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in the Sudan (UNITAMS) until 3 June 2023 and requested the Secretary-General to report every 90 days on its implementation. The report covers developments in the Sudan from 21 August to 20 November 2022 and contains an update on the implementation of the Mission's mandate, with gender considerations integrated throughout as a cross-cutting issue.  **II. Significant developments**  **A. Political situation**  2\. More than a year since the military coup of 25 October 2021, some indications of a potential breakthrough to end the political crisis in the Sudan have been observed. National, regional and international efforts aimed at facilitating a political solution to restore a civilian-led transitional Government continued, amid pressing humanitarian, social and security needs.   3\. The trilateral mechanism, consisting of the United Nations, the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), continued its efforts to support Sudanese stakeholders in fostering a political agreement. Several local political initiatives focused on arrangements for a possible future transitional period were put forward by political and civilian forces. On 10 September, the Sudanese Bar Association presented its draft constitution to the mechanism. The draft was developed by a committee composed of various political party groupings, civil society organizations and prominent academics. It was signed by the Forces for Freedom and Change (FFC)-Central Council, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)-Original, the Popular Congress Party and Ansar al-Sunna, among other groups, as well as a range of civil society organizations, women's groups and professional associations.   4\. In subsequent weeks, the signatories of the Sudanese Bar Association draft constitution continued their efforts to broaden their support base, build consensus and address the remaining issues in the text with a view to setting the stage for negotiations with the military. In parallel, bilateral negotiations between some signatories of the draft constitution and the military resulted in a preliminary understanding on key issues between them. On 24 October, the trilateral mechanism received comments from the military based on that preliminary understanding and was asked by the military to launch a structured political process to facilitate negotiations on the remaining differences. Subsequently, the mechanism engaged intensively with the stakeholders to facilitate political talks aimed at reaching a broadbased civilian and military agreement. On 6 November, in a speech to soldiers and officers at Hattab military base in Khartoum, the Chairperson of the Sovereign Council and the Commander of the Sudanese Armed Forces, Lieutenant General Abdel-Fattah Al-Burhan, in the presence of the Chief of Staff and Heads of Units, confirmed that understandings had been reached with the civilian component, underscoring that the military was not aligned with any political group, and warned the National Congress Party, the Islamist Movement and others that they would not be allowed to return through the armed forces. On 13 November, Lieutenant General Al-Burhan spoke at the Markhiyat operational base reiterating similar messaging.   5\. The Sudan Liberation Movement-Transitional Council and the Gathering of the Sudan Liberation Forces, both signatories of the Juba Agreement for Peace in the Sudan, participated in the work of the Sudanese Bar Association. Meanwhile, non-signatories reiterated their refusal to participate. The Sudan Liberation Movement-Abdel Wahid (SLM/AW) faction rejected dialogue with the military. The Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) Abdelaziz al-Hilu faction criticized the document for its failure to address the root causes of the conflict. Peace talks between the latter faction and the Government of the Sudan have not yet resumed, pending the restoration of a civilian Government and a return to constitutional order.  6\. Other civilian forces also presented alternative visions for the transitional period. On 28 September, the resistance committees of Khartoum published a document, entitled The Revolutionary Charter to Establish People's Power, which was signed by some committees from 18 states across the Sudan. The Charter was intended to unify the resistance committees around a broad political vision that included a revolutionary legislative council, formed through a grass-roots process, that would serve as the supreme authority and through which the Prime Minister would be selected. On 8 October, FFC-National Consensus (which includes some signatories of the Juba Peace Agreement), FFC-National Forces, DUP-Original and other parties signed a political declaration that included a proposal for amending the 2019 Constitutional Document.  7\. Throughout the reporting period, resistance committees and activists continued to organize protests to denounce military rule and call for an end to the military coup and a return to a civilian Government. While the protests remained largely peaceful, security forces in some cases continued to respond with excessive and disproportionate use of force, resulting in the injury of at least 415 people, mainly from live ammunition, stun grenades and tear gas. As the country marked one year since the coup on 25 October 2021, protests were held across the country by resistance committees and activists on 21, 22 and 23 October. An 18-year-old protester was shot and killed by security forces on 23 October. On 25 October, thousands of people participated in mass protests in major towns across the Sudan. One protester was killed in Khartoum after he was reportedly shot by security forces, bringing the total number of people killed in protests since 25 October 2021 to 119, including at least 21 children and one woman. In a statement issued after 25 October 2022, the Sudanese Police Force reported incidents of targeted violence against the police by organized groups that were unaffiliated with the protest. The United Nations cannot independently verify that information. The police continued to carry out mass arrests during large protests, usually releasing protesters within 48 hours, after charging them with public order offences. During the reporting period, protesters reportedly affiliated with the former regime staged three demonstrations in front of UNITAMS, accusing the Mission of foreign interference in the country's internal affairs.  8\. In Darfur, the situation remained relatively stable, with a reduction in largescale violence compared with the previous reporting period. The local reconciliation agreements concluded in June and July 2022 in West and South Darfur helped to improve stability in the area. On 4 October, the Governor of the Darfur region, Minni Arko Minawi, convened a meeting of the five Darfur state Governors and the native administration in El Fasher to discuss security challenges. A regional native administration body was established to reconcile communities.  9\. Significant intercommunal clashes took place in Blue Nile and West Kordofan States. The fighting in Blue Nile has increased in scope and has expanded to new areas, with many people killed, injured and displaced. The situation escalated, with protesters from the Funj tribe holding demonstrations in front of the Governor's office in the state capital, El Damazin, on 20 and 21 October. The protesters demanded the Governor's resignation, the cancellation of the Juba Peace Agreement and the withdrawal of certain security forces from the region. The Government's subsequent deployment of additional security forces helped to curb violence. A delegation from the Blue Nile State native administration and leaders from the Hausa community held separate meetings with government officials and UNITAMS to discuss the causes of the conflict and ways forward.   10\. In West Kordofan State, clashes erupted between the Misseriya and Hamar tribes in Abu Zabad town on 12 September, when tensions between the communities regarding land ownership in the locality escalated. Three people were reportedly killed, and four injured. A cessation of hostilities agreement was brokered through local mediation efforts and signed by tribal representatives on 19 September. Members of the Hamar community also organized two road blockades, one starting on 24 August and one starting on 1 October, to demand secession from West Kordofan and the formation of a new state of 'Central Kordofan'.  11\. On 18 August, two leaders of the SPLM-N Sudanese Revolutionary Front, Malik Agar and Yasir Arman, announced an amicable split. Consequently, on 21 August, 33 individuals, including a former federal government minister, Buthaina Dinar, established the SPLM Democratic Revolutionary Movement, headed by Yasir Arman.  12\. Nine individuals from the Misseriya community who had been in custody of the SPLM-N Abdelaziz al-Hilu faction in South Kordofan since August were released and taken to Juba on 11 October, following mediation by the President of South Sudan. On 27 October, UNITAMS was able to secure the release of two women health-care workers in the custody of that faction and evacuate them from the area under the faction's control. The operation was supported by members of the United Nations country team.   13\. In the eastern part of the Sudan, tensions among communities persisted, in particular within the Beja High Council, which remained divided. On 1 October, Mohamed Taher Aila, who had previously served as Prime Minister in the former Government of Omer Al-Bashir, as Governor of Red Sea State and as a prominent member of the dissolved National Congress Party, returned to Port Sudan from Egypt. On 26 October, Nazir Tirik, the leader of one faction of the Beja High Council, rejected the talks conducted between the military and civilians in Khartoum and called for self-determination for the East if Eastern demands were not met. On 9 November, a rival faction of the Beja High Council claimed sovereign authority for the Beja in the East.","['Epidemic', 'Flash Flood', 'Flood']","['Food and Nutrition', 'Health', 'Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding', 'Protection and Human Rights']","['Eritrea', 'Ethiopia', 'South Sudan', 'Sudan']",UN Document

3785251,"Syrian authorities have executed 24 people accused of involvement in igniting the wildfires that ravaged the country last year. In a Facebook post on 21 October, the Syrian Ministry of Justice described the 24 men as 'criminals who carried out terrorist attacks that led to deaths and damage to infrastructure and public property'. It also said 11 others were sentenced to life in prison in the same case and nine, including five children, received prison sentences.  Responding to the news, Lynn Maalouf, Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International, said:  'The Syrian state has embarked on a horrifying execution spree which exposes its callous disregard for the right to life and contempt for international law. Our research over the years has shown that death sentences are often passed after secret trials without the most basic fair trial guarantees or based on torture-tainted confessions. The death penalty is a cruel punishment and can never be justified ' no matter the offence.  'The Syrian authorities should immediately impose a moratorium on the death penalty and work towards its complete abolition. They should also ensure that all criminal procedures and trials follow international standards of fairness.'  **Background**  Executions are common in war-torn Syria, although the government tries to keep them behind closed doors. Until this day, the Syrian Penal Code allows for the death penalty and Syria remains a retentionist state.  In 2017, Amnesty International exposed the Syrian government's campaign of extrajudicial executions by [mass hangings at Saydnaya Prison.]( ) Before they were hanged, the victims were condemned to death in flagrantly unfair and shambolic 'trials' at the Military Field Court located in Damascus, which lasted between one and three minutes. Between 2011 and 2015, as many as 13,000 people, most of them civilians believed to be opposed to the government, were hanged in secret at Saydnaya.  The death penalty is the ultimate cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment. Amnesty International opposes the death penalty in all cases without exception, regardless of the nature or circumstances of the crime; guilt, innocence, or other characteristics of the individual; or the method used to carry out the execution.",['Wild Fire'],['Protection and Human Rights'],['Syrian Arab Republic'],News and Press Release

The strategic lines of the plan are epidemiological surveillance, strengthening of health centers for the treatment of cases, water/sanitation and promotion of hygiene at the community level.  - UNICEF has begun actions for the prevention and response to the cholera outbreak in the DR, based on the experience and in coordination with PAHO/WHO. Among these is strengthening the leadership of the Ministry of Public Health so that it coordinates actions and guarantees the complementarity and homogenization of approaches for a comprehensive approach to people at risk.  - At the moment no actions have been planned to support the humanitarian response in Haiti, but communication and epidemiological surveillance are ongoing.  **Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs**  On October 1st, 2022, Haitian national authorities reported a confirmed case of Vibrio cholerae in the greater Port-au-Prince area, Haiti. The disease has been spreading and as of October 26th, the Haitian Ministry of Public Health reports 2,274 suspected cases, of which 1,642 cases are hospitalized and 52 have died. 51% of reported suspected cases are under 19 years old. The most affected age group is 1 to 4 years, followed by 5 to 9 years.  Despite the efforts of the Haitian Government and international support, the political and social situation in Haiti does not favor control of the outbreak. The violence of the gangs that operate in Puerto Principe and the surrounding area makes it difficult to access the most affected areas, making it impossible to detect and timely treat cases. Access to drinking water, basic hygiene supplies, and energy is limited, affecting both disease prevention and case management.  In Dominican Republic the first cholera case was confirmed on October 20th, 2022, in the province La Altagracia, located in the eastern region of the country, in which the water and sanitation systems have been severely affected by Hurricane Fiona and there are still communities where the population does not have access to safe drinking water and excreta disposal system.  In the Dominican Republic, the number of Haitian population deported to Haiti is increasing. They are taken to migrant detention centers which do not have water neither sanitation solutions and hygiene services constituting a route of transmission and expansion of cholera between the two countries, since many of the deported people find other ways to return to the Dominican Republic again. The social and economic crisis in Haiti has generated a more intense migratory flow towards the eastern side of the island, thus increasing the risk of cholera spread.  According to Enhogar 2019, although 98% of households use improved sources of drinking water, contamination by E. Coli in drinking water affects 54.8% of children and adolescents in the Dominican Republic (increased to 79% when measured inside the house). In addition to this, it is highlighted that the access to water is not continuous especially for the poorest population in the country, forcing families to store water from public sources or other unsafe sources.  Barely 8.8% of households with children and adolescents use drinking water purification methods such as boiling, adding bleach or chlorine, filtering with a cloth, using a water filter, among others, and only 26% of children, girls and adolescents from the poorest quintile have soap and water to wash their hands","['Epidemic', 'Tropical Cyclone']","['Contributions', 'Coordination', 'Health', 'Water Sanitation Hygiene']",['Dominican Republic'],Situation Report
3697718,"SC/14386  After much progress in the peace process in South Sudan earlier in 2020, implementation is now lagging and needs urgent attention from the international community, the United Nations top official in that country told the Security Council today.  'Momentum in South Sudan's peace process is linked to the strength of international engagement,' David Shearer, Special Representative for the Secretary-General and head of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) said in a briefing on developments since September.  Introducing the Secretary-General's latest 90-day report (document S/2020/1180) on the newly independent and conflict-steeped country, he said that 2020 saw the formation of a transitional Government, created through compromise by the parties and led by President Salva Kiir with First Vice-President Riek Machar. In addition, 9 of 10 Governors appointed in the last quarter have resumed their functions, although all other state and county executive and legislative positions remain vacant. As well, the Council of Ministers is meeting and most national institutions are functioning, at least at a basic level.  'These achievements are to be commended. But progress is lagging,' he said. Arrangements to unify security forces are stalled and a dispute over governorship in the Upper Nile, which is also halting the appointment of country commissioners. This hold-up leaves a local vacuum of power and makes it difficult to nip in the bud brewing intercommunal violence. It is understandable, he added, that international attention in the Horn of Africa has been drawn elsewhere, but focus must be renewed on South Sudan to avert a resurgence of volatility. At the same time, he urged the parties to take concrete steps to breathe fresh life into the peace process.  So far in 2020, he said, more than 2,000 civilians have died in local-level conflict which is being 'weaponized and turbocharged' by external actors acting in their own economic or political interests. Given a 'perfect storm' of humanitarian threats, he said that historically, the dry season exacerbates these problems, with competition for scarce resources like grazing land and water raising tensions between farmers and cattle herders.  Anticipating this, UNMISS has established five new temporary bases in conflict hotspots in line with its 'proactive, robust and nimble' approach. Integrated military and civilian teams are in place right now, to deter violence, de-escalate conflict and support reconciliation between parties. The Government's refusal to enable Mission access to many areas has hampered this work, although restrictions have recently eased.  The addition of a multi-donor trust fund to bring reconciliation, stabilization and resilience together will target the underlying causes of violence through a wide partnership. UNMISS's engineering contingents have also undertaken a major roadbuilding programme that will build peace through interregional trade and communications. Meanwhile, at the national level, the Mission is promoting inclusive dialogue on vital aspects of the peace process.  He said that the transition of the protection of civilians sites to conventional displacement camps has started, due to the wind-down in intense conflict and continued need for humanitarian access. In the past three months, Bor, Wau and Juba sites have transitioned smoothly, through consultation with all stakeholders. Planning is under way at other sites as well, but transitions only take place when the conditions are right, he added. At all sites, the Mission remains engaged in support of the displaced communities. In addition, United Nations police officers are collocated with their national counterparts, providing them with training for community policing as the Government assumes ownership of the sites with UNMISS technical support.  The changes, he said, followed the recently completed independent strategic review of UNMISS. Heeding the review, the strategy going forward will have as its central goal political progress in a regional context, while providing protection to those who need it most through a nimble profile that will allow for a gradual downsizing of overall force numbers. It will also focus on strengthening the South Sudan National Police Service and addressing impunity through increased support to the justice system, building on the success of the mobile courts. Preparations must also begin for elections and focus must intensify on security sector reform and, ultimately, disarmament and reintegration, he added.  Mark Lowcock, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said people in parts of South Sudan are on the brink of famine today. The global Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) real-time quality review identified five counties in Jonglei, Warrap and Northern Bahr el Ghazal States — Akobo, Aweil South, Tonj East, Tonj North and Tonj South — where 5 to 10 per cent of the population is living in IPC 5. That means they face 'catastrophe', or famine, levels of food insecurity. In some places, the number of people in IPC 5 is set to increase between now and July 2021. While the analysis at the country level is being finalized, the IPC Famine Classification Review Committee presented a 'famine likely' situation in western Pibor County last week. 'I think it would be fair to say that our fears from September have now materialized in these six counties,' he said.  Violence remains one of the main drivers of severe food insecurity in South Sudan, he said. In the first half of 2020, four successive waves of major violence in Jonglei and the Greater Pibor Administrative Area displaced nearly 160,000 people. In Warrap State, where three counties with IPC 5 classification are located, nearly 100,000 people were displaced due to violence between May and June. Two consecutive years of intense flooding have worsened the situation. More than half a million people in Jonglei and the Greater Pibor Administrative Area, and close to 400,000 people in Warrap State, have been affected by the compounded effects of flooding and fighting. COVID-19 and its socioeconomic impact has made life even harder as South Sudan's economy keeps contracting, driven by the drop in oil prices. Essential commodity and food prices are spiking as the exchange rate depreciates and inflation takes hold.  To stave off famine, the Central Emergency Response Fund and South Sudan Humanitarian Fund are critical tools in the international community's response. South Sudan received $39 million from the Response Fund in 2020 and a substantial proportion towards food insecurity. Humanitarian agencies and non-governmental organizations in the country are scaling up a multisectoral response in all six counties. Yet, the international community needs more funding to ensure food and livelihoods, health services and other life-saving programmes are supported in the six counties and across the country. The South Sudan Humanitarian Response Plan for 2020 is the largest ever, with nearly $2 billion needed. Yet, only two thirds is funded as of December. He credited humanitarian colleagues in South Sudan, most of them South Sudanese. The humanitarian response in the country has kept millions of people from sliding into famine. Aid agencies have assisted more than 6 million people across the country in 2020. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), World Food Programme (WFP) and partners have already treated nearly 600,000 children affected by severe or moderate acute malnutrition, with a 94 per cent recovery rate. 'This shows how effective support can be, if people get the help they need and aid workers are able to do their job,' he said.  Three key actions are necessary to prevent famine in the country, he said, adding 'the time to avert looming famine in South Sudan is now'. First and foremost, efforts to find political solutions to end the violence must continue. Humanitarian partners are concerned that a spike in violence in early 2021 is likely as the dry season starts in Pibor and other parts of the country. Secondly, humanitarians need sustained support from the Government of South Sudan for safe and unhindered access to people in desperate need. Finally, humanitarian partners need to urgently scale up assistance, including protection efforts, on a 'no-regrets basis', in areas facing severe food insecurity.  Dang Dinh Quy (Viet Nam), Chair of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 2206 (2015) concerning South Sudan, said that, since the beginning of 2020, it received three exemption requests to the arms embargo, two of which were granted. Also, four exemptions requests were received concerning the travel ban and asset freeze measures, all of which were granted, he reported, encouraging Member States to continue strengthening their cooperation with the Committee and the Panel of Experts.  The members of the Panel of Experts have been unable to travel to that country since the outset of this mandate due to the coronavirus pandemic, he continued. The Committee's work has equally been affected by COVID-19, with most of its meetings held via videoconferencing. However, the Committee has continued to work efficiently to fulfil its mandate. To date, it has met on one occasion in person, and on four occasions in closed videoconferencing. On 7 February, the Committee heard a presentation by the Coordinator of the Panel of Experts in a meeting open to all Member States, concerning the Panel's interim report (document [S/2019/897]( )).  In April, the Committee received a presentation by the Panel of Experts concerning the Panel's final report (document [S/2020/342]( )) and discussed the recommendations contained in it through a written format. In a closed videoconference on 25 June, the Committee heard a presentation by the Panel of Experts in a meeting open to South Sudan's neighbouring countries, concerning the Panel's final report and heard a briefing by the Permanent Representative of the Sudan in his capacity as Chair of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) on the group's most recent efforts to support the implementation of the 2018 peace agreement in South Sudan.  In a closed videoconference on 7 August, the Committee heard a presentation by the Coordinator of the Panel of Experts on its work plan, he continued. On 16 October, again in a closed videoconference, the Committee received a briefing by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict. Finally, in the closed video conference held on 20 November, the Committee heard a presentation by the Panel on its interim report and discussed the recommendations contained in it.  Following those briefings, Security Council members took the floor, commending the advances made in South Sudan and calling for accelerated progress in implementing the revitalized peace agreement. Many, welcoming the engagement of regional actors, including the African Union and IGAD, urged non-signatories to accede to the agreement. Expressing concern over sexual violence and other human rights violations, several speakers called for operationalization of special courts that had been proposed to combat impunity. Council members also stressed the need to ensure the participation of women and youth in the country's efforts. Some, in addition, urged review of the sanctions regime with a view towards lifting the measures, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, while others stressed the need to keep weapons out of the hands of armed groups, endangering civilians and the peace process.  France's representative expressed regret that the formation of the National Assembly transitional legislative process and the appointment of the Governor of the Upper Nile are delayed, and progress is lacking in the participation of women and young people. To fight against impunity, the formation of unified forces and the establishment of the hybrid court must be expedited. The increase in kidnappings of civilians in the Equatoria region by armed groups is also worrying. In this regard, France welcomes mediation efforts by the Sant'Egidio community to engage armed groups who have not signed the 2018 peace agreement. Protecting civilians and facilitating humanitarian access will remain at the core of the UNMISS mandate. South Sudanese authorities must gain expertise in this area, with the Mission's support. Her Government supports keeping the sanctions regime put in place by resolution 2206 (2015), including the arms embargo, the implementation of which must be improved by South Sudan and States in the region.  The representative of China welcomed progress in South Sudan, but stressed that the political process must be pushed forward. He hoped that all parties will engage in dialogue to resolve differences over Upper Nile. The international community, he said, should respect the independence of the country, as well as the involvement of IGAD in advancing the revitalized peace process. Noting humanitarian and economic challenges in the country, he said that international partners should increase assistance and explore means for South Sudan to pursue sustainable development. His country will continue assisting Juba in its quest for peace and development in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, he pledged. In that context, he called for support to the African Union initiative for lifting sanctions on the country. He welcomed the Mission's work in protection, support to the revitalized agreement and addressing other challenges in South Sudan.  The representative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, speaking also on behalf of Niger, South Africa and Tunisia — the A3+1 — welcomed positive developments in the South Sudan peace process, calling the country a maturing democracy that is determined to confront the trials of these unpredictable times. In that context, he looked forward to the national conference on the Upper Nile State to address outstanding issues there. He also stressed the importance of meeting the 35 per cent minimum quota for women in institutions of the transitional Government. Noting that inclusivity is key to the peace process, he called on the non‑signatories to the Revitalized Agreement to join.  Welcoming, in addition, the maintenance of the ceasefire, he noted, however, a lag in security sector reform that he called critical to tackling intercommunal violence. He called for further international support in that regard, especially to facilitate the full operationalization of the unified forces. He also expressed concern over a humanitarian situation worsened by the pandemic, the economic crisis and climate change, as well as violations of human rights and humanitarian law and the status-of-forces agreement with UNMISS. Stressing the paramount importance of protection of civilians, especially women, children and other vulnerable persons, he applauded the start of operations of South Sudan's Gender‑Based Violence and Juvenile Court. He also expressed appreciation for the contributions of humanitarian partners in the country, encouraging donors to meet the Response Plan target. He called, in addition, for the lifting of unilateral coercive measures considering the COVID-19 pandemic. The A3+1 stands in solidarity with the people of South Sudan and its regional and international partners, he affirmed.  The representative of the United Kingdom said it is a sad and profound reality that, more than two years since the peace agreement and one year since the Council visited Juba, millions of South Sudanese have yet to feel any real peace dividends. Food insecurity and famine have increased and the food security analysis, released on 11 December, shows there is likely to be a famine in western Pibor with thousands more people living in famine-like conditions in five other counties. Resolution 2417 (2018) places the onus on the Council to act when it sees a clear link between conflict and food insecurity. 'This is unmistakably the case in South Sudan. The situation will only worsen if we do not act,' he said. The United Kingdom is a major humanitarian donor in South Sudan and committed an additional $10 million in assistance in October. That is in addition to its annual humanitarian aid spending, which totalled $218 million in the last financial year. Yet international support and humanitarian aid cannot solve the problems alone. The ultimate responsibility lies with South Sudan's Government, which should support the release of the full food security analysis and give humanitarian partners unfettered access. Stability can only be achieved through a fully inclusive process. It is vital that UNMISS can carry out its mandate unhindered. South Sudan's Government needs to see the donor community and the United Nations as partners in helping them solve this crisis.  The representative of Estonia said the reports by the Panel of Experts and the Secretary-General make for grim reading. Implementation of the revitalized agreement has mostly stalled while deadlines for military unification and Government institutions are not taken seriously enough. Economic reforms and the establishment of key transitional justice institutions, like the hybrid courts, have not been carried out. The Upper Nile still has no Governor, which would make local mediation efforts easier. Estonia is very disturbed about the continued, extensive involvement of heavily armed civil defence groups in subnational violence and its impact on civilians. Given the horrendous human rights violations in South Sudan, Estonia remains supportive of sanctions and the territorial arms embargo. Allegations on how the arms embargo damages the equipping of a unitary army, and therefore the prospects of peace, are misleading since there are provisions for exceptions. Estonia encourages the South Sudanese authorities to promote local accountability initiatives that comply with international humanitarian law standards. It is sad that humanitarian access has deteriorated, primarily with the ongoing hostilities against humanitarian workers. He called on the South Sudan Government to help the international community deliver humanitarian aid. UNMISS has experienced an exponential increase in access denials for its patrols. He called on the South Sudanese authorities not to obstruct the peace process, but to help achieve it.  Indonesia's representative, noting that more than 1.6 million people remain internally displaced and over 1 million people affected by heavy rains and floods, emphasized the critical importance of humanitarian assistance and urged the Government of South Sudan to enhance its cooperation with UNMISS to ensure an effective provision of aid for all in need. The increase in intercommunal clashes is closely linked to the stalled political process, especially the implementation of the Transitional Security Arrangement, he said, urging all stakeholders, especially UNMISS, IGAD and the African Union, to step up its effort in supporting the Government in broadening dialogue and championing compromises to progress this stalled process. Jakarta believes the sanctions regime must never exist as a punitive measure but should facilitate the implementation of the revitalized peace agreement. That should remain the primary element of benchmarks.  The Russian Federation's representative emphasized that the revitalized peace agreement is working. Despite some problems in implementation, it is important to note that the South Sudanese parties have demonstrated political will to find common ground. Citing a steady increase in the return of South Sudanese refugees and internally displaced persons to places of their permanent residence, she said this is the result of confidence-building measures by the parties. Emphasizing the importance of finding African solutions to African problems, she said progress on South Sudan's peace was achieved thanks to the political will of the parties and the efforts of regional mediators, rather than sanctions pressure and unilateral restrictions. Her delegation expects that in accordance with resolution 2521 (2020) benchmarks for lifting sanctions must be reviewed and adapted to the realities on the ground.  The Dominican Republic's representative, stressing the importance of women's participation in all decision-making processes, welcomed the announcement of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) that the quota of 35 per cent of women would be applied in the remaining seats assigned to the party and that the two main parties in the country are now led by females. It is essential that, through political will, the gender provisions of the peace agreement are fully implemented at all levels of appointments. She also welcomed the initiative of the Ministry of Youth to create the business development fund for youth. Developing the capacities of youth is an essential piece in the peace process in South Sudan. More attention must be paid to the pending transition tasks in governance, security, economy, humanitarian assistance and transitional justice. When these provisions are effectively applied, they will pave the way for State-building in South Sudan.  The representative of Belgium expressed concern over a stalemate in security arrangements in South Sudan and voiced hoped that the upcoming conference on Upper Nile could lead to progress in that regard. She said it is also worrisome that mechanisms to ensure accountability for violations of human rights have not been set up. She called on all parties to pursue full implementation of the revitalized peace agreement. In that context, UNMISS must maintain its protection work, she stressed. Calling on the Government to allow unhindered access for UNMISS to fulfil its mandate, she termed 'unacceptable' any obstacles that hinder the delivery of humanitarian aid. Noting also the high risk of illegal exploitation of natural resources by armed groups, she called on all stakeholders to address that issue with urgency.  The representative of the United States, welcoming political progress in South Sudan, looked forward to seeing further progress as soon as possible. Given the dire situation of the population due to persistent instability, floods and food insecurity, he said that now is the time for the leadership to ensure purposeful implementation of the peace agreement, particularly in the areas of governance, security arrangements and transitional justice, with meaningful participation of women in all spheres. Creation of the hybrid tribunal is critical, he stressed, as is the engagement of regional partners. Noting his country's top role in humanitarian assistance to the country, including for the pandemic, he said that all donors must work to meet the increased needs. Noting also his country's support for UNMISS, he affirmed the continued importance of civilian protection. His country, he added, continued to assess the arms embargo in light of changing conditions, but he noted that the embargo already includes exemption for security forces, and other armed groups must not have access to weapons that could be turned against civilians or endanger the peace process. He pledged his country's commitment to continue to work with all partners for a better future for the people of South Sudan.  The representative of Germany said there has been some progress in the country with some implementation of the peace agreement, less violence and the transitional Government partially in place. It is important to recognize the progress. Unfortunately, there are still many deficiencies and negative developments. The critical task of the revitalized peace agreement remains outstanding and traditional security arrangements have not been implemented. There are no unified security forces or traditional parliament. Accountability is crucial to peace and reconciliation in the country. The humanitarian situation is being aggravated by flooding, which is a repercussion of climate change. Similar to the situation in Yemen, large numbers of people are now facing famine, which is unacceptable. Nine humanitarian workers have been killed. Those responsible must be brought to justice. He regretted that the Ambassador to South Sudan is not present. It is disrespectful to the Council, the countries that engage their Blue Helmets and the large donors of humanitarian aid. He would like to ask the Ambassador to have the Government stop placing impediments to the Mission's movements in the country. 'It is unacceptable that UNMISS doesn't have free access to all parts of the country,' he said. He would also ask South Sudan's Ambassador to convey to Juba that more financial transparency is needed. It is incomprehensible that a potentially rich country is facing a famine. He said he cannot follow the argument that sanctions and the arms embargo should be lifted. There is no unified security force and fragmentation exists in the chain of command. To lift the arms embargo is to ask for more conflict. He did not think COVID-19 was a reason for lifting the embargo. He asked all parties desperate to send arms to instead send increased deliveries of humanitarian goods to the country. The lifting of sanctions would promote impunity. Sanctions are very important in the present situation.  The representative of Viet Nam, speaking in his national capacity, said that South Sudan has achieved important progress on the political and security fronts even as it faces challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, heavy floods and other natural hazards in recent months. Yet despite the developments, progress in implementing the 2018 peace agreement remains slow and intercommunal violence remains concerning. Viet Nam calls on the South Sudanese parties to fully implement the peace agreement, particularly reconstituting the Transitional National Legislative Assembly and forming the necessary unified forces. The permanent ceasefire needs to be upheld. He encouraged UNMISS to strengthen its support to improve South Sudan's capacity to protect civilians. Viet Nam will keep contributing to the Mission's work and promote its deployment of female peacekeepers. The country's economic and humanitarian challenges must be addressed, including the high level of food insecurity. Finally, Viet Nam reiterates its consistent position that sanctions shall only be a tool, applied by the Council in a temporary and case-by-case manner, to help maintain international peace and security. These measures and their implementation should not adversely affect the livelihood of people, the Government's essential functioning, or the legitimate development of the country concerned. The measures should be subject to review, in accordance with developments on the ground, and be removed when the conditions are met. In this regard, Viet Nam looks forward to the timely establishment of the benchmarks on the arms embargo, with the aim of facilitating the review and subsequent lifting of its measures.  **For information media.

3833175,"**Key messages**   - A deadly mix of conflict, COVID-19 and the climate crisis have pushed more than 7 million people across seven countries in East Africa to the very brink of a hunger crisis. Of critical concern are vulnerable children who are experiencing high levels of malnutrition.  - Conflict is the leading driver of hunger globally. Every country where World Vision works in East Africa is either in conflict or neighbouring a country in conflict.   The region has also endured substantial climate shocks, undermining people's ability to feed themselves, and the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are driving hunger to unprecedented levels. Conflict and weather shocks have resulted in multiple instances of large-scale displacement in northern Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia and areas of South Sudan.  - Humanitarian needs are immense and the impact on children, including safeguarding risks, is enormous. This challenging period could also erode human and economic development gains that have been made towards the global 2030 Sustainable Development Goals across the region.  - World Vision is deeply concerned for millions of children in East Africa, who are enduring a devastating hunger crisis. According to the Food Security and Nutrition Working Group special report of 10 February 2022, an estimated 5.5 million children are acutely malnourished, including more than 1.6 million who are extremely acutely malnourished, in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia.  - World Vision has reached more than 5.7 million people, including 3 million children, through its East Africa Hunger Emergency Response. We are already responding with food distribution in multiple countries. World Vision has re-declared its multi-country response comprising Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. We aim to reach approximately 7 million people, including 3.4 million children. World Vision has been implementing a multicountry hunger emergency response in the above-mentioned countries for the last 12 months and was able to repurpose and raise new funds, to the tune of US$ 132 million. However, the needs have insurmountably increased and we require an additional US$ 77 million.","['Drought', 'Epidemic', 'Insect Infestation', 'Other']","['Agriculture', 'Food and Nutrition', 'Health', 'Protection and Human Rights', 'Water Sanitation Hygiene']","['Ethiopia', 'Kenya', 'Somalia', 'South Sudan', 'Sudan', 'Uganda']",Situation Report

1614241,"##Ministry of Agriculture Program helping Nguna, Pele & Emao farmers prepare for La Niña  We've all heard about and seen the effects of El Niño on Vanuatu's food security this year:  Crops dying, rivers drying up and people travelling long distances to find enough water to drink, cook and clean. But now that we are passed the El Niño period, scientists are warning that another climate extreme may be coming our way: La Niña.  We are on a La Nina 'Watch', with a more than 50% likelihood of La Niña forming later in 2016 according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).    The last time we experienced a La Niña in Vanuatu was in 2010-2012, and it caused huge problems for our farmers. La Niña brings above normal rainfall to most of Vanuatu, causing flooding, water-logged soils, washed out market roads and additional pests and diseases to crops.   After the devastating impacts from Cyclone Pam and the severe El Niño of 2015/2016, farmers on Nguna, Pele & Emao are taking no chances.  With the help of a Ministry of Agriculture DEZA Resilience program, supported by the Swiss & German governments, SHEFA province and the Nguna-Pele Marine and Land Protected Area Network, farmers have started constructing special backyard gardens with special La Niña focused adaptations.   Offering a package of backyard garden material, extension officers from the Department of Agriculture, SPC/GIZ and SHEFA province ran comprehensive trainings this week for over 100 farmers on each of the islands of Nguna, Pele and Emao.  At the trainings, farmers learned how to construct the simple backyard garden, protected from the potential impacts of La Niña by raised seed trays, elevated planting beds and polybags, organic pesticides, and off-season coverings and treatments.  The package of materials, subsidized by the Swiss-German DEZA project, includes everything farmers need to get started growing vegetables that are resilient to climate variability from El Niño and La Niña.  The most surprising part of the training for farmers was the advice about a potential La Nina towards the end of 2016. 'We survived Cyclone Pam, and are just recovering from the El Niño drought; now we have to start thinking about La Niña and the rain it may bring…farming is becoming harder and harder to do now with climate change,' said Emao farmer Sandy Oscar.   Backyard gardens are only one component of the DEZA II food security program being rolled out on Nguna, Pele and Emao by the Ministry of Agriculture, SPC/GIZ & SHEFA Province to strengthen local food security. Each of the 22 communities and 5 schools has been working on food-security related developments since March of 2015.  These activities have included community gardens, solar cookers, backyard poultry and now backyard gardens. The goal is for at least 200 individual households to have access to their own-grown fresh and healthy vegetables by the end of 2016 despite ongoing climate challenges.   The workshops were facilitated by the Department of Agriculture's Robinson Solomon as well as local farming expert Mr. John Epot, who worked with SPC/GIZ to design the climate-proofed backyard garden. Through a combination of classroom lessons and practical exercises with seed sowing, transplanting and vegetable maintenance, both female and male farmers learned everything they needed to know for successfully growing vegetables in their backyards.  Mr. Solomon reminded participants to 'start small,' but that they must take climate and disaster preparedness very seriously for food security.   Four farming cooperatives have been established on Nguna, Pele and Emao in order to support the backyard farmers through the growing, harvesting and marketing of their vegetables. Chairman of the Nguna-Pele Marine and Land Protected Area Network, Mr. Tatu Whitely, explained that 'farmers pay for the backyard garden materials at a subsidized price, ensuring that people see an economic value in their garden, with the proceeds going directly to the island farming cooperatives to fund future activities to support local farmers.'

3899519,"Recent conflicts in Afghanistan and in the meantime prolonged drought mostly in the north and western regions have forced many people to leave their homes and become displaced within or outside the country. The internally displaced people (IDPs) are in dire need of humanitarian assistance primarily health facilities.  One village currently hosting a large number of IDPs is the Urdubagh village in the Guzara district of Herat province. The IDPs in the village and the host community had no access to a clean water source and had to use unsafe drinking water, leading to diseases, particularly among children. On the other hand, they had to fetch water from far distances, facing many challenges.  Abdul Wahid, 51, a resident of Urdubagh village, says that the villagers and IDPs were not aware of hygiene messages and did not know the importance of safe drinking water and its effects on infectious diseases, hence in the past, they bore high expenses for the treatment of diseases.  ""We did not have access to safe drinking water and it took hours to fetch clean water from other villages. But after the implementation of DACAAR's project, all challenges are resolved and we have received hygiene messages and kits."" Abdul Wahid explained.  With funding from Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund (AHF), DACAAR implemented an Emergency WASH assistance in Nangarhar, Kunar, Farah, and Herat provinces. The project aimed to respond to the WASH emergency humanitarian needs of people affected by drought and conflicts.  From April to September 2022, the project provided WASH assistance to over 51,000 affected people including host communities and IDPs in mentioned provinces through the rehabilitation of non-functional wells, construction of new safe water sources, chlorination of unprotected wells, establishment of handwashing facilities, and setting up of water surveillance early warning systems in drought-affected provinces. In addition, the DACAAR provided each target family with three hygiene education sessions and distributed hygiene kits to each family. The hygiene promotion component covered topics such as Covid-19, acute watery diarrhea (AWD), personal hygiene, safe water collection and storage, the importance of washing hands with soap and waste management.  During the project, in the Urdubagh village of Guzara district, DACAAR rehabilitated two non-functional public wells and provided hygiene education and kits to 30 vulnerable families. In addition, DACAAR chlorniated several unprotected wells in the area. For each water point, DACAAR established a water user group, and trained the community mechanic and a caretaker in the targeted population to make sure the future operation and maintenance of the well.  The beneficiaries admit that with access to safe drinking water and considering hygiene messages, diseases have decreased in their community significantly and their health status has improved drastically.  They are determined to persuade their families and all villagers to be bound to use clean water and follow hygiene education so that they can enhance the community's health and prevent diseases and additional costs of treatment.  Abdul Wahid consisted: ""The way of living in the community has changed now and hygiene practices have become common among villagers. All beneficiaries are content and want the implementation of such projects in other areas too.""  Sidebar quote:  *""We did not have access to safe drinking water and it took hours to fetch clean water from other villages. But after the implementation of DACAAR's project, all challenges are resolved and we have received hygiene messages and kits."" *Abdul Wahid, Herat province.

3902675,"9178TH MEETING (AM)    SC/15093  The Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine has driven the fastest, largest displacement witnessed in decades, with some 14 million people forced from their homes since 24 February, Filippo Grandi, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, told the Security Council today.  Although humanitarian organizations have scaled up their response, much more must be done — first is ending the senseless war, he said.  The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' (UNHCR) focus is increasingly on helping displaced people in Ukraine, while trying to be present wherever there is forced displacement, he emphasized.  Notwithstanding the European Union's open, well-managed and shared response, UNHCR is maintaining a high level of preparedness for further population movements, both inside and outside Ukraine, given the likely protracted nature of the military situation.  'In the past 12 months alone, UNHCR has responded to 37 emergencies around the world.  Yet, the other crises are failing to capture the same international attention, outrage, resources and action,' he emphasized.  Detailing the situation of displaced persons across the globe, from Myanmar's Rohingya refugees to Afghan and Syrian refugees, and those displaced in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia, he voiced concern that crisis and protracted situations are not only fading from media attention, but are being failed by global inaction.  The confluence of climate change and conflict has created very protracted displacement, he underscored, urging greater international and support for inclusion and integration both in refugee contexts and situations of internal displacement.  Responses to climate change must consider both its link to conflict, and the displacement it causes, he stressed, voicing hope that they will be in clear focus at the upcoming twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth Conferences of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  The international community, starting with Council members, must overcome divisions at the very least on humanitarian issues, he stressed.  Voicing alarm at the major funding gap in 2022, he pointed out that food aid for refugees has been cut in many operations.  He urged strengthening the capacity of the police, judiciary and local Government and overall rule of law in fragile countries.  Humanitarians must be able to operate everywhere lives must be saved, he stressed.  In the ensuing discussion, Council members, united in their concern about the increase in refugees and protracted conflict, highlighted the ways in which they are supporting UNHCR and persons displaced from different parts of the world.  Several delegates urged equal treatment for all seeking refuge, while others called for greater funding for UNHCR and unimpeded humanitarian access.  Ireland's representative, on that point, stressed that there can be no impunity for those who target humanitarian actors or who seek to use starvation as a weapon of war.  As carve-outs are an important principle for any sanctions regime, he said Ireland, together with the United States, has put forward a proposal to mainstream humanitarian carve-outs across all sanctions regimes.  Mexico's representative, spotlighting refugees' other critical needs, called on UNHCR to systematically include mental‑health services and psychosocial support in its regional and national responses.  His country is the third largest receiver of new claims for refugee status, he said, noting that 72 per cent of these claims have received a positive response.  He expressed hope that the Global Refugee Forum in 2023 will generate comprehensive solutions to guarantee the rights of all refugees and internally displaced people.  Kenya's representative expressed grave concern about the worrying trend in recent years of people of African descent travelling to Europe via the Mediterranean, who suffer extreme human rights violations, with thousands losing their lives.  They must be treated humanely and given opportunities to make a decent living, he stressed, calling for the international community's renewed commitment to assist countries in tackling the root causes of displacement.  The representative of the Russian Federation pointed to the 'irresponsible policies of Western States' as the cause of conflicts, poverty and economic inequality that have forced populations out of their countries of origin.  The Ukrainian crisis has intensified because of the unwillingness of authorities encouraged by Western patrons to not implement the Minsk agreements, he said.  China's representative, noting that 83 per cent of refugees are supported by developing countries, called on the international community to mobilize resources and strengthen cooperation to ensure refugees are protected.  The Council must assume its primary responsibility of promoting political settlements and fostering a peaceful environment, through support for post-conflict rebuilding and creating favourable conditions for refugees to return, he said.  Also speaking today were representatives of the United States, France, Brazil, Gabon, Albania, United Arab Emirates, India, Norway, United Kingdom and Ghana.  The meeting began at 10:04 a.m. and ended at 12:14 p.m.  Briefing  FILIPPO GRANDI, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, thanked Ghana, which holds this month's Security Council presidency, for its commitment to refugee protection, inclusion and solutions.  He asked Council members to look at the multiplicity of global challenges — growing conflicts, climate emergency, pandemics, energy and food crises — through the eyes of the more than 103 million refugees and displaced people, who are among the most impacted by all of them.  He noted that, in so doing, they will feel with desperate urgency the need for the international community to cooperate to reverse the current trajectory and find solutions, while regrettably also observe the 15-member organ's failure to do so.  The Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine has driven the fastest, largest displacement witnessed in decades, he underscored, noting that some 14 million people have been forced from their homes since 24 February.  Ukrainians are about to face one of the world's harshest winters in extremely difficult circumstances.  Humanitarian organizations have dramatically scaled up their response, but much more must be done, starting with an end to the senseless war, he said.  The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' (UNHCR) focus is increasingly on helping displaced people in Ukraine, working under the Government's able leadership, he said, pointing out that among the neighbouring countries, the Republic of Moldova continues to need special attention, given its vulnerability.  Meanwhile in the European Union, he said UNHCR has seen an open, well managed and above all shared refugee response that has proven wrong many of the statements frequently repeated by some politicians:  that Europe is full; that relocation is impossible; that there is no public support for refugees.  Given the likely protracted nature of the military situation, UNHCR is maintaining a high level of preparedness for further population movements, both inside and outside Ukraine, considering different possible scenarios and the scope and limitations of humanitarian assistance.  'In the past 12 months alone, UNHCR has responded to 37 emergencies around the world.  Yet, the other crises are failing to capture the same international attention, outrage, resources and action,' he said.  UNHCR is trying to be present wherever there is forced displacement, such as in Ethiopia where more than 850,000 were displaced in the first half of 2022, he continued.  He called on the Council to urge a positive outcome of talks between the parties in South Africa, warning that failure in peace talks would undoubtedly bring more death, destruction and displacement, and further restrict UNCHR's already limited ability to reach those in need, in Tigray and other regions.  UNHCR is also in Myanmar, where an estimated 500,000 people were also displaced in the first six months of 2022, with humanitarian access remaining a huge challenge.  Conditions for the return of almost a million Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, where options for them are limited, remain a very distant possibility, he added.  In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, brutal attacks, including revolting accounts of sexual violence against women, has added more than 200,000 people to the 5.5 million already displaced in the country.  These crises, and many more, including the countless protracted situations like those of Afghan and Syrian refugees, and some of the multiple, complex population flows in the Americas, are not only fading from media attention but are being failed by global inaction, he stressed.  The intersection of climate change and displacement, in many situations, includes a clear connection with conflict as well, he pointed out, underscoring that climate change is ravaging resources that have sustained communities for generations.  This creates tensions, often of an intercommunal nature, especially in already fragile contexts where Governments do not have the assets or even control of territory to support adaptation and resilience strategies and programmes, he added, voicing concern that without greater attention and much greater financing for prevention, adaptation, and development and governance support, tensions, frustrations and competition will grow and spark wider conflict, with deadly consequences, including displacement.  He recalled his meeting last week in Somalia with emaciated men, women and children who had walked for days to get help, including mothers whose children had died en route.  They were people who had outlived conflict just to have their last remaining coping mechanisms — their crops and their cattle — die before their eyes, he said.  There, and elsewhere, conflict is also an obstacle to relief, as humanitarians are often prevented from helping people in their places of origin by insecurity and fighting.  He also met with Somali refugees pushed into already drought-affected areas of Kenya, he said, highlighting that country's generations' long extraordinary hospitality to refugees and its landmark shift from encampment of refugees to inclusion.  The confluence of climate change and conflict has created very protracted displacement, he underscored, urging greater international and support for inclusion and integration both in refugee contexts and situations of internal displacement.  He voiced concern about the many hotspots affected by that spiral, especially throughout the Sahel, where the convergence of climate change, poverty, and weak governance with the action of armed groups, and the often-brutal reaction of Governments, have already displaced 3 million people, including increasingly to coastal States like Ghana, as well as to North Africa and Europe.  Responses to climate change must consider both its link to conflict, and the displacement it causes, he stressed, voicing hope that they will be in clear focus at the upcoming twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  UNHCR has stepped up legal support to States; upped its operational response for those displaced by climate and conflict, like in the Horn of Africa, the Sahel or Mozambique; increased efforts to reduce the environmental damage caused by massive displacement, such as in Niger or Bangladesh; and used artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to try and at least prepare for displacement of this nature.  Underscoring key areas for support, he called for greater resources for humanitarian aid, which is under enormous pressure.  UNHCR, despite a record level of income, including $1 billion from private donors, faces a major funding gap in 2022 in some of its crucial operations.  Food aid for refugees, for example, has been cut in many operations for lack of funding despite the help of the United States and other Council members, at a time where food insecurity is growing, he said, stressing the crucial importance of the continuation of the Black Sea Grain Initiative.  Peacebuilding must be seriously strengthened by reinforcing the capacity of the police, the judiciary, local government and overall rule of law in fragile countries.  In addition, humanitarian action must be better safeguarded, from different viewpoints, he said, stressing that parties to conflicts must protect humanitarian work and enable access those in need.  Furthermore, everyone must uphold international humanitarian law and contribute to preserving the civilian character of refugee settings.  'No matter how polarized the context, humanitarians must be able to operate everywhere lives must be saved,' he stressed, welcoming the Council's current efforts to ensure greater predictability in humanitarian carve-outs.  'We need the international community, starting with you, members of the Security Council, to overcome your divisions and disagreements at least when you discuss humanitarian issues; and hopefully when you address the root causes that are displacing people around the world,' he urged.  Those that have contributed the least to global challenges are suffering most from their consequences, he stressed.  Statements  MICHAEL KIBOINO (Kenya) expressed deep concern about the continued increase in refugees due to protracted armed conflict, economic crises and climate change impacts, noting that 83 per cent of refugees globally are hosted by developing countries, with the least developed providing asylum to 7 million people — representing a 27 per cent of the global total of refugees.  Host countries, particularly developing ones, shoulder the largest responsibility of the global refugee crisis, despite formidable challenges.  Many of these challenges are experienced by his own country, he continued, noting that the High Commissioner had witnessed first-hand the situation of refugees in Kenya, in Kakuma and Dadaab camps, as well as witnessed how the ravages of drought in Somalia are leading to a devastating double tragedy of displacement, first by conflict, and then by extreme weather events.  Kenya will continue to uphold its obligations to host and protect refugees and will continue to advocate for continued burden and responsibility sharing in line with the global compact on refugees.  He went on to call for sufficient funding to enable UNHCR and other humanitarian agencies, pointing out that the international community has consistently underfunded appeals made by developing countries and the Refugee Agency.  Further, wealthiest countries with high-employment economies should do more to resettle refugees, beyond providing support to UNHCR.  He expressed grave concern about the worrying trend in recent years of people of African descent travelling to Europe via the Mediterranean, who suffer extreme violations of their human rights, with thousands losing their lives, and called for them to be treated humanely and given opportunities to make a decent living.  He went on to call for the root causes of displacement to be comprehensively tackled, including through renewed political commitment from the international community to assist source countries.  LINDA THOMAS-GREENFIELD (United States) expressed hope that Council members will support a proposal that her country and Ireland have put on the table to create a standardized humanitarian carve-out for those under sanctioned regimes.  She shared that her Government has launched 'Uniting for Ukraine', a process for Ukrainians to seek humanitarian parole in her country, providing refuge for over 190,000 people so far.  Recalling that the drought in Somalia has displaced nearly 1 million people in 2022, she reported that her country provided over $850 million this year as part of its efforts to address the situation in the Horn of Africa, while calling on others to follow suit.  Expressing alarm over reports that refugees returning to Syria have faced torture, arbitrary detention and forced disappearance, she urged the Council to 'put politics aside' and extend the cross-border aid mandate in January.  Also touching on the situations in Ethiopia, Kenya and Venezuela, she commended UNHCR's new initiative which emphasizes the need of innovative approaches, especially new digital tools for enhancing community feedback.  NICOLAS DE RIVIÈRE (France) noting the 'sad record' of 100 million displaced persons across the globe in 2022, pointed to multiple causes, from climate change to food insecurity.  Saluting the remarkable courage and dedication of all personnel at the Refugee Agency, he noted that the Russian Federation's aggression has resulted in the largest population displacement in the world since the Second World War.  His country has pledged to provide humanitarian aid and is welcoming Ukrainian refugees, he said, adding that France has also doubled voluntary contributions to UNHCR since 2021, making the country the Refugee Agency's eighth largest donor.  Further, France will co-sponsor the next Global Refugee Forum at the end of 2023.  Stressing that his country will not compromise on the fundamental principles regarding return of refugees, he called on Damascus to remove all obstacles preventing the return of Syrian refugees.  JOÃO GENÉSIO DE ALMEIDA FILHO (Brazil) stated that his country has granted protection through its humanitarian visa policy to people affected by the conflicts in Afghanistan and Ukraine, along with Haitians and Syrians.  He added that since 2018, over 770,000 Venezuelan migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers have received assistance from its 'Operation Welcome'.  Noting the reports of unintended consequences of United Nations sanctions on humanitarian assistance, he encouraged the Council to continue its work to adjust the sanctions framework, so that they effectively minimize the suffering of civilians.  While acknowledging that sanctions can be legitimate and effective when they are multilaterally created, strategically targeted and designed to have minimal impact on the civilian population, he pointed out that they will have unintended consequences, but that the humanitarian space must always be preserved.  MARTIN GALLAGHER (Ireland), noting the Russian Federation's war against Ukraine, said his country has welcomed and given shelter to tens of thousands of Ukrainians.  Underscoring the indisputable link between climate change and displacement, he said that for the Council to fully understand conflict drivers and consequences, it has the responsibility to understand the impact of climate on security.  Greater humanitarian aid is needed for the Horn of Africa, he stressed, calling on the Council to redouble its attention to instability, conflict and the pursuit of peace.  Those blocking aid delivery must cease and facilitate immediate unhindered humanitarian access, he said, stressing that there can be no impunity for those who target humanitarian actors or who seek to use starvation as a weapon of war.  Turning to the situation in Haiti, he said Haitians who are seeking refuge must not be turned away or sent back.  Carve-outs are an important principle for any sanctions regime, he pointed out, noting that Ireland, together with the United States, has put forward a proposal to mainstream humanitarian carve-outs across all sanctions regimes.  The Council has the responsibility to use tools available when required, but they must be effective and without unintended consequences for humanitarian efforts.  Moreover, it must hear directly from refugees and displaced people — those bearing the brunt of Council inaction and inadequacy, he said.  Ireland's funding for UNCHR continues to grow with core funding at its highest level ever, he said, affirming ongoing support for the High Commissioner and the Refugee Agency.  MICHEL XAVIER BIANG (Gabon), citing figures from UNHCR, noted that since 2021 the world has seen 42 new emergency situations in 30 countries, forcing displacement, adding that the war in Ukraine has displaced millions of people in that country and around Europe.  Further, climate change is worsening the situation, spurring forced displacement, particularly in the Sahel and Horn of Africa, which is only set to worsen in the future, he said, adding:  'However, the international community is not doing enough to share the cost of protecting those seeking asylum.'  The current financing does not make it possible to respond to the myriad challenges, including food insecurity, epidemics, the safety of women, particularly in refugee camps, and providing access to education for the youngest.  He called for true cooperation for equitable burden sharing.  While hailing Ukraine's neighbours for their solidarity in hosting most claimants fleeing the war, he regretted the policies of many to deter asylum-seekers, which are short-sighted and force women, men and children to put their lives in danger, while benefiting smugglers trafficking in human beings.  'The Mediterranean Sea is an immense cemetery of shame, which is the final resting place for unknown numbers of indigent Africans and young people who only sought to improve their fortunes,' he stressed, calling for greater international support on a political, security, financial and humanitarian level, adding that such support 'must not vary according to geography'.  The right to asylum is the most symbolic of human rights, and refusing to receive asylum-seekers or discriminating against them is a violation of human rights.  GENNADY V. KUZMIN (Russian Federation), noting that conflicts, poverty and economic inequality continue to force populations out of their countries of origin, stressed that this is due to the 'irresponsible policies of Western States' which have imposed their dictate and carried out geopolitical experiments in weaker countries.  Describing the situations in African States, Libya, Syria and Afghanistan as 'hotbeds of mass migration', he particularly called on UNHCR to continue supporting the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to their homelands.  Asserting that the Ukrainian crisis has intensified because of the unwillingness of the authorities encouraged by Western patrons to not implement the Minsk agreement, he shared that his country is making every effort to accommodate refugees, providing them with assistance in employment, education and health care. He pointed out that UNHCR staff based in Moscow have made regularly visits to temporary accommodation centres for internally displaced persons in various regions and have noted the effectiveness of their work.  ALBANA DAUTLLARI (Albania), noting that the war in Ukraine has affected more than 40 million people, said it has taken emergency response to new heights.  Responding to such crises should be in 'in addition to' and not 'instead of' other crises, she said, adding that the international community must not forget the millions of people displaced worldwide, from Myanmar to Burkina Faso to Ethiopia to Yemen and elsewhere.  The Council must continue searching for solutions by supporting countries of origin and host countries, and by ensuring that people can rebuild their lives if they make the choice to return.  'It's important to be united in giving the right signals,' she said, adding that the Council must overcome divisions.  Commending the efforts of UNHCR in meeting the increasing protection needs, she also applauded refugee-hosting countries worldwide that welcome millions and continue to demonstrate solidarity.  AMEIRAH ALHEFEITI (United Arab Emirates), voicing concern about the numerous challenging and complex humanitarian situations around the world, including Afghanistan, Myanmar and Ukraine, said her country continues to provide humanitarian assistance worldwide, including in support of Syrian and Rohingya refugees, as well as to internally displaced persons in Ethiopia.  Addressing the root causes and contributing factors of forced displacement must remain the Council's number one approach to prevent its occurrence in the first place, she underscored.  To end conflicts peacefully, political solutions, dialogue and support for de-escalation must remain the building blocks of its efforts.  That approach is also more efficient and cost-effective, as it ensures that the most vulnerable can remain in their homes in secure conditions, she pointed out.  Recalling the RewirED Summit in 2021 in her country, she said finding new ways to provide education to those forcibly displaced can mitigate the risk of leaving them behind and build their capacities to contribute to their futures.  To that end, her country has sought to invest in innovative education tools, including the 'Digital School' launched in 2022 to train educators and provide distance learning for children, including youth in refugee camps, including in Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.  Noting that climate change is and will continue to increase forced displacement at an alarming rate, she stressed that effective mitigation and adaptation strategies are necessary to lessen the impact of climate change on forced displacement.  GENG SHUANG (China) expressed concern about the severe lack of funding against the backdrop of growing humanitarian needs, noting that the number of forcibly displaced persons exceeded 100 million in 2022, hitting a 'record high', adding:  'The fact that the UNHCR has had to lower its relief standards is of great concern.'  Noting that 83 per cent of refugees are supported by developing countries, he called on the international community to mobilize resources and strengthen cooperation to ensure refugees are protected.  Such protection should be non-political, and the credibility of refugee status must be safeguarded.  The Security Council must assume its primary responsibility of promoting political settlements and fostering a peaceful environment, through enhanced cooperation with the Peacebuilding Commission, and support for post-conflict rebuilding, alleviating refugees' plight and creating favourable conditions for refugees to return.  Turning to Ukraine, he commended its neighbours, who host millions of displaced Ukrainians, and called on the international community to increase support to help bring about a political solution.  On Palestine, he expressed concern about the millions of Palestinians who have been displaced, their homes occupied and their rights trampled on, calling on the international community to provide adequate funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), and to promote a just and lasting solution to the Palestine question.  On Syria, he pointed out that the 7 million refugees hosted by neighbouring countries are 'the bitter fruit of military intervention', and called on the international community to introspect to avoid the recurrence of such tragedies.  Turning to Afghanistan, where 11 million people had been displaced, millions to Pakistan and Iran alone, he called for the maintenance of a constructive engagement towards peaceful rebuilding and the return of refugees, adding that the issue of frozen overseas assets should be addressed to help Afghans out of their plight.  On the Rohingya, he noted that Myanmar and Bangladesh are moving towards initial repatriation efforts towards the end of 2022, and called on the international community to lend greater support to UNHCR.  RAVINDRA RAGUTTAHALLI (India), noting that the concerned States have the primary responsibility to protect and assist internally displaced persons, stressed that international action must remain within the bounds of the concept of sovereignty and should only be at the request of the country concerned.  Pointing to the need to focus on preventing people from being forced to leave their homelands, he underscored that preventing armed conflicts, countering terrorism and building and sustaining peace through facilitating sustainable development and good governance remain critical.  Highlighting that Member States and UNHCR must avoid politicization of the humanitarian work, he encouraged the Refugee Agency to continue to help build, strengthen and use national capacities for protection and humanitarian action.  Recalling that humanitarian aid has become more important due to the global economic slowdown, he called upon Member States to provide indiscriminate and equitable services to refugees and take them into due account in national response strategies.  JUAN RAMÓN DE LA FUENTE RAMÍREZ (Mexico) stated that violence, poverty, lack of opportunities, political instability and climate change all contribute to more people being forced to leave their homes, as is the case in Ukraine, Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan and Somalia.  Noting that the measures imposed in Afghanistan restricting the rights of women and girls also affect their decision to move to other regions or to leave the country, he stressed the importance of acknowledging that females are disproportionately affected by the various factors leading to displacement.  He called on UNHCR to systematically include mental health services and psychosocial support in its regional and national responses.  Sharing that his country is the third largest receiver of new claims for refugee status, he pointed out that 72 per cent of the claims have received a positive response.  He expressed hope that the Global Refugee Forum to be held in 2023 will be a good opportunity to analyse comprehensive solutions based on recently acquired experiences to guarantee the rights of all refugees and internally displaced people.  MONA JUUL (Norway) expressed concern about the high number of children being forcibly displaced amid the increasing number of armed conflicts around the world, noting that many of them are alone and at high risk of recruitment to armed groups.  She went on to outline several negative trends that must be reversed, including warfare in urban areas, which is killing and injuring civilians, destroying homes, schools and hospitals, and depriving people of access to basic services and means of survival, adding that the Russian Federation's war against Ukraine is 'a horrifying example of this'.  Such challenges are compounded by climate change, environmental degradation and rising food insecurity, both as a consequence and a driver of conflict, leading to further displacement, as seen in Sahel, the Horn of Africa and elsewhere.  She called for stronger political will to address root causes and prevent conflict and displacement, and for the Secretary-General's mediation efforts to be supported.  Further, parties to conflict must protect civilians and reduce the risks that drive displacement, and comply with refugee law and human rights.  She stressed the need for protection to be at the core of the humanitarian response.  Further, durable solutions must be sought to benefit both the displaced and their host communities.  Norway supports the global compact on refugees and welcomes the Secretary-General's Action Agenda on internal displacement and the appointment of a Special Adviser.  She called on the global community to show greater solidarity through broader burden- and responsibility-sharing, and for more countries to be engaged, along with international financial institutions and the private sector.  Flexible, unearmarked funding is key to meet changing and growing needs, she added.  JAMES KARIUKI (United Kingdom), commending the efforts of UNHCR, echoed 'others' horror at President Putin's latest atrocities', and noted that the crisis in Ukraine is but one example of the need to address the drivers of displacement.  From Ethiopia to Syria to Myanmar, the international community owes it to the millions of refugees and displaced to find practical solutions to prolonged crises.  Also calling on the Council to continue to ensure that actors on the ground meet their responsibilities to international humanitarian law, he added that this means ensuring that refugee returns are voluntary, safe and dignified, and allowing humanitarians to safely carry out their work unhindered.  His country is taking lifesaving action, he said, highlighting its International Development Strategy and the plan to contribute over $3 billion to global humanitarian needs over the next three years.  HAROLD ADLAI AGYEMAN (Ghana), Council President for November, speaking in his national capacity, expressed concern about the continuous rise in global refugee numbers, which stood at 100 million individuals in May 2022.  Noting that the war in Ukraine has been a key driver, he added that in many parts of continental Africa, the situation remains dire with more than 26 per cent of the world's refugees hosted in the region.  In Somalia, the number of people displaced internally by drought in 2022 alone is nearing 1 million, in addition to those displaced due to conflict and insecurity.  Highlighting the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 protocol, he encouraged Member States to implement those agreements as well as the global compact for refugees, adopted in 2018.  The increasing rate of refugees on his continent requires deeper cooperation between the United Nations and regional arrangements, he said, highlighting continental initiatives such as the African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa which came into force in 2012.  Mr. GRANDI, responding to questions and comments, thanked delegations who had expressed support for UNHCR, its partners and staff, and affirmed the Refugee Agency's continued work despite the challenges it faces.  He said he mentioned climate change to highlight the complexity of movement and urge that those factors be considered in current discussions on the climate emergency, including at the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties.  The Council's work is closely linked to that of UNCHR, he said, noting that the agency 'picks up the pieces' when the 15-member organ does not manage to arrive at political solutions.  The best way to assist UNHCR is by continuing to work on political solutions, he emphasized.  Recalling his symbolic visit to Cote d'Ivoire on 23 June — World Refugee Day — he highlighted that 90 per cent of the country's refugees had gone back after years of civil war.  When positive political action happens, then solutions to displacement occur, he underscored.  All people fleeing armed conflict, discrimination or persecution are equal and must be treated equally.  However, there is inequality in the way victims of the worst situations are treated, he said, affirming that UNCHR will continue to remind all to uphold that principle.  On the Ukrainian refugee crisis, he cited the Canadian ambassador who, at the Third Committee's meeting on 1 November, underscored that the way Ukrainian refugees have been treated should not be the exception but the norm on which to build a model on hosting refugees.  Further on supporting UNHCR, humanitarian agencies and non-governmental organizations, he said it is also important to ensure that there is no backtracking in development assistance.  Without simultaneously building resilience, refugees' immunity to shocks and hardships will continue the spiral of humanitarian assistance that is unsustainable in the long-term.  UNCHR is 'spread very thin', he stressed, pointing that this is the first year in his seven years as High Commissioner that he shares the funding gap with alarm, warning of potential cuts in cash assistance to host countries.  Underscoring that humanitarian access is particularly difficult in 'theatres of conflict', he called for urgent and successful peace talks for the resumption of aid delivery.  He voiced support for the carve-out initiative led by Ireland and the United States, stressing UNCHR's need for clarity and flexibility to operate in difficult political circumstances.  Having to negotiate too much with whoever controls a territory becomes cumbersome, he pointed out.  As such, the Council's help in that regard would be invaluable and urgent.  On mental health, he said that the UNHCR Executive Committee's resolution recognizes mental health as a very important part of the agency's humanitarian response given the traumatic nature of conflict.  He agreed with the need to step up efforts in Somalia, stressing the importance of collective responsibility in that regard.  Voicing concern about the humanitarian situation inside Syria, he agreed that more early recovery efforts are needed, assuring the delegations of the Russian Federation and others that UNCHR will continue to talk constructively with the Government of Syria to remove obstacles that prevent people from returning.  Turning to Haiti, he said he would appeal in the next few days to States receiving Haitians to not return them to the country given the extremely fragile and worrying situation.  UNHCR will continue to work wherever Ukrainian refugees are present, he said, noting his forthcoming meeting with a Ukrainian refugee community in Japan.  The Refugee Agency is also working with the Russian Federation in respect of Ukrainian refugees present in its territory, he said, noting UNCHR's small operation in the country.  Voicing support for China's recommendations, he stressed the importance of creating conditions for the return of Rohingya refugees and cooperation between Bangladesh and Myanmar.  Although important, dialogue alone will not guarantee their return, he pointed out, stressing that discrimination and other such concerns must be lifted for people to return.  He echoed calls for support of UNWRA, noting the importance of that agency's work with Palestinian refugees.  Recalling the important 'toolbox' approved by the General Assembly four years ago, he said those tools are available to Council members and other countries to improve the response to the refugee and displacement crisis.  Looking ahead, he said the Global Refugee Forum will be held again at the end of 2023, voicing hope that Member States will invest and participate in that meeting.  **For information media.

The Volcanic Alert Level remains at Level 1.**    The Vanua Lava volcanic activity is continuing at the low unrest level, consistent with the Volcanic Alert Level 1. New scientific analysis suggest that the volcanic activity is likely to continue at this same level of minor unrest. Volcanic hazards remain on the volcanic cone and sulfur river (e.g. volcanic gases). Danger Zone for life safety is limited around the volcanic cone and the sulfur river.      Latest observations and satellite data confirm that there is no significant manifestation and the volcanic activity conditions remain stable. There is an ongoing presence of volcanic gases around the volcanic cone and around the sulfur river. Gas smell will continue while approaching these two areas.     The Volcanic Alert Level for Vanua Lava volcano has been at the Level 1 since 27th May 2016. The current observations are consistent with the activity of the Volcanic Alert Level 1. Level 1 indicates 'Minor level of unrest; Danger Zone is near the volcanic area and the sulfur river' .     Vanua Lava volcano is one of the active volcano in Vanuatu and in contrast to other large volcanoes in the country, it does not contain a youthful summit caldera. A chain of small stratovolcanoes, oriented along a NNE-SSW line, gives the low-angle volcano an irregular profile. Historically, this volcano had low infrequent activity except in XIX (19) century with 3 moderate manifestations and in XX (20) century with 2.      All tourism agencies, visitors, local authorities, and people on Vanua Lava Island and general public are reminded that due to the current volcanic activity, the danger zone remains at around **the sulfur river and volcano area**. In these areas, volcanic gases will always be expected. Visitors may expect impact of this gas while approaching these two areas.

3697461,"**HIGHLIGHTS**  - Women and children in Pakistan require urgent support due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, an ongoing nutrition emergency and recurrent disasters. There are now 346,000 confirmed cases of COVID-191 and the global acute malnutrition rate is 18 per cent.2  - In its response to COVID-19, UNICEF is prioritizing prevention and supporting health service continuity by empowering health workers with gender-responsive training and essential equipment. In addition, UNICEF is providing timely/accurate information; promoting behaviours that reduce risk and limit transmission; facilitating infection prevention and control; supporting learning continuity; providing psychosocial support; and working to prevent stigma.  - UNICEF is also responding to the chronic nutrition emergency with curative and preventive life-saving services, including community management of acute malnutrition; maternal, infant and young child health; and infant and young child feeding services.    - UNICEF requires US$55.7 million to provide a life-saving response in Pakistan, mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 and ensure preparedness for recurring natural disasters.  **HUMANITARIAN SITUATION AND NEEDS**  The first imported case of COVID-19 was reported in Pakistan on 25 February 2020. As of 10 November 2020, there are more than 346,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, including over 319,000 patients who have recovered and been discharged and 7,000 deaths.7 Pakistan is now facing a second wave of COVID-19 cases. The test positivity rate has increased from 1.6 per cent on 1 October to 5.1 per cent as of 10 November. A public health response is needed to prevent disease transmission and ensure the continuity of basic services.    The Government has declared 20 cities/geographical locations (23 districts)8 with the highest number of cases to be COVID-19 hotpots. Due to lack of continuity of essential health services, the risk of additional morbidities and mortalities is significant, and women and children urgently need access to care.  Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) infrastructure is urgently needed, as washing hands with soap ' a key COVID-19 prevention measure ' has increased the burden on water services. Without safe and effective WASH facilities/services in schools, health care facilities and communities, an estimated 550,000 children will be at risk of malnutrition and preventable diseases, including diarrhoea, typhoid, cholera and polio.9  The closure of nearly 197,000 educational facilities has severely disrupted the already weak education system and jeopardized the learning of millions of children in Pakistan.10 Before the pandemic, 22.8 million children were out of school in Pakistan.11  Pakistan is also seeing a rise in child protection risks in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, including physical and emotional mistreatment, gender-based violence, psychosocial distress and mental health challenges. A recent study12 found that lack of educational opportunities was a common source of stress for caregivers, making children more vulnerable to violent discipline.  Pakistan is facing a chronic nutrition emergency. The national global acute malnutrition rate is nearly 18 per cent,13 exceeding the internationally agreed emergency threshold of 15 per cent.    If urgent action is not taken, this will lead to rising mortality rates among children under 5 years. A recent study estimates that child wasting could lead to an 18 per cent increase in young child mortality.Pakistan also suffers from recurrent natural shocks (earthquakes, floods, drought and epidemics) and strengthened preparedness is critical to support effective responses to future emergencies.","['Cold Wave', 'Epidemic', 'Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Tropical Cyclone']","['Disaster Management', 'Education', 'Food and Nutrition', 'Health', 'HIV/Aids', 'Protection and Human Rights', 'Water Sanitation Hygiene']",['Pakistan'],Appeal
3868765,"*This week - as temperatures topped 40C in parts of the UK for the first time ever - Megan Lawrence, Kickstart Project Assistant for Save the Children in Wales, reflects on how important it is to listen to the voices of future generations and their concerns on climate change.*  My interests in climate change began in primary school during a lesson on which items we should put in the recycling, such as plastic bottles, glass jars and old newspapers. We were taught that not everything can be recycled with soft plastic, such as cling film and shopping bags - the worst offenders causing widespread pollution.  Even from a young age, this sparked concerns about protecting the environment, which only grew with time. I chose subjects such as Geography for GCSE and A-Level and learnt even more about the impacts on the environment and what the future holds.  I have grown up knowing that human-induced climate change is the defining issue of our time with disruptive implications on places, species, and people's lives. From the rise in sea levels to more extreme weather patterns such as heatwaves, floods, droughts, and wildfires, the impacts of climate change are felt in every corner of the world.  Now aged 22, I am as passionate as I was during my primary and secondary school days about bringing about meaningful change in mitigating the effects of the climate crisis. Before joining the Save the Children Cymru team, I spent seven months campaigning with Climate Cymru during the run-up to COP26. The campaign focused on giving people a voice and calling on the Welsh Government to protect Wales from the pending climate and nature emergencies.  This week red and amber warnings were placed for extreme heat in parts of the UK with temperature in parts of England soaring over 40C for the first time ever. Devastating floods have also become a big threat in the UK and in February 2020, the worst storms to hit Wales in recent history affected over 3,000 homes and businesses across the country. Alarmingly Cardiff, where I was born and raised, has been named as one of the most at risk cities from global warming by 2050, alongside Bangkok, Melbourne, and Amsterdam.  **CLIMATE CHANGE AND CHILDREN**  The effects of climate change are clear and reveal the terrible costs to children now and in the future. [Research by Save the Children and Oxfam]( ) found that one person is likely dying on every 48 seconds in the Horn of Africa, where climate change is fuelling recurring droughts and unpredictable weather conditions.  48 seconds. That is not even enough time to make a cup of tea or listen to a song!  In 2011, a devasting famine killed over a quarter of a million people in Somalia -- half of them children under the age of 5. More than a decade later, despite repeated warnings, particularly over the last the two years, the United Nations predicts that 350,000 Somali children may die by the summer if governments and donors do not tackle food insecurity and malnutrition immediately.  Malnourished children are far more vulnerable to infection because their immune system is weakened, which is worrying as they are likely to be exposed to diseases such as malaria due to changes in weather patterns. These impacts will only become worse as the country is on the frontline of the climate crisis. Somalia used to experience one severe drought every ten years, but children born in 2011 or earlier are already facing their third drought - only highlighting the fact that [children today face three times as many climate disasters than their grandparents did.]( )  **WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD?**  I recently read [Save the Children's Future of Childhood report]( !), which was carried out across the UK and asked nearly 450 children aged between 4 and 11 years old to share their vision for what they would like the future to look like in 2040.  The children who took part in this research cared a lot about the environment and the world around them. They are worried about climate change and want children in the future to have the same opportunities to connect with animals, plants, and green spaces. Children were worried about the future of trees and wanted to stop them from being cut down instead of planting more so that future generations could enjoy them. They also want to protect honeybees and keep the sea, beaches, and air clean. They suggest that in the future, everyone should do more recycling and walk instead of driving, to be ""kind to nature"".  Children are clear about what they want for their future, but I feel their voices are underrepresented in environmental discussions, despite being the major stakeholder in their outcomes. Most of the perspectives considered in policy, discussions, disaster management and relief efforts are targeted at adults. Children have the right to participate meaningfully in decisions that affect their life, survival and development and contribute to policies that impact their rights. After all, the UN climate change assessment warns that the world will likely reach a dangerous 1.5°C of warming by the year 2040, eighteen years from now when I will be forty years old.  By then I may have children of my own and I often do wonder, or should I say worry, about the impacts of climate change on them and on their children. Young people are not passive victims but are valuable contributors to climate action. They are agents of change, entrepreneurs, and innovators who can use their skills to accelerate climate action and hold others accountable.  The African proverb, ""any small people, who in many small places do many small things, can alter the face of the world"", reminds me that change is possible  Let's keep giving the children of today a say in what their future looks like.",['Heat Wave'],['Climate Change and Environment'],['World'],News and Press Release
3671600,"**I. Introduction** 　　  1 . The present report is submitted pursuant to Security Council resolution [2514 (2020)]( (2020)), by which the Council extended the mandate of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) until 15 March 2021 and requested me to report to the Council on the implementation of the Mission's mandate every 90 days. It covers political and security developments between 1 June and 31 August 2020, the humanitarian and human rights situation and progress made in the implementation of the Mission's mandate.  **II. Political and economic developments** 　　  2 . On 17 June, the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, and the First VicePresident, Riek Machar, reached a decision on responsibility-sharing ratios for gubernatorial and State positions, ending a three-month impasse on the allocations of States. Central Equatoria, Eastern Equatoria, Lakes, Northern Bahr el-Ghazal, Warrap and Unity were allocated to the incumbent Transitional Government of National Unity; Upper Nile, Western Bahr el-Ghazal and Western Equatoria were allocated to the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army in Opposition (SPLM/A-IO); and Jonglei was allocated to the South Sudan Opposition Alliance. The Other Political Parties coalition was not allocated a State, as envisioned in the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan, in which the coalition had been guaranteed 8 per cent of the positions.  3 . On 29 June, the President appointed governors of 8 of the 10 States and chief administrators of the administrative areas of Abyei, Ruweng and Pibor. On 17 July, the governor of Jonglei was appointed, a decision objected to by the National Democratic Movement (a member of the South Sudan Opposition Alliance), which argued that it had further prevented it from participating in the Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity because its nominee had not been considered. The Upper Nile governor position remains vacant owing to disagreement over the nomination of Lieutenant General Johnson Olony, whom the President refused to appoint.  4 . Although the Revitalized Agreement requires 35 per cent participation of women in all institutions of governance, only one woman nominated by SPLM/A-IO was appointed as governor. On 2 July, women leaders issued a communiqué addressed to the President, calling on the parties to adhere to the 35 per cent quota. 　　  5 . On 10 August, a high-level committee on the formation of State and local governments reported that the parties had agreed on 10 State governors, one of whom was a woman, and their deputies, 10 speakers of State assemblies and their deputies and 79 county commissioner positions. They also agreed on 35 county councils, 17 ministers, 51 members of State assemblies, 5 State advisers, 6 chairpersons, 6 commission deputies and 8 specialized committees in each State. The responsibility for nominating mayors, their deputies and secretaries-general was entrusted to the governors.  6 . As a result of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, political activity remained limited. The First Vice-President and the Vice-President, James Wani Igga, along with other cabinet members who had previously tested positive for COVID-19, resumed their duties. The resumption of duties did not, however, translate into full normalcy in government operations because pandemic-related restrictions prevented sustained engagement among parties, stakeholders and mediators. While efforts were undertaken to employ online modes of interaction, technical and organizational challenges hindered those initiatives.","['Drought', 'Epidemic', 'Flood', 'Other']","['Food and Nutrition', 'Health', 'Mine Action', 'Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding', 'Protection and Human Rights', 'Safety and Security', 'Shelter and Non-Food Items', 'Water Sanitation Hygiene']",['South Sudan'],UN Document
3898363,"*AUTHORS* *Dan Walton , Erica Mason*  **Introduction**  In 2022, record-high food prices, supply-chain disruptions and increasing climate and conflict risks are causing millions of people across the globe to face worsening levels of food insecurity. But the trend toward greater food insecurity is not simply a product of current events. The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) 2022 highlights that the population considered in need of urgent action due to acute food insecurity doubled between 2016 and 2021. Food insecurity can cause, deepen, or worsen humanitarian crises, and understanding the most effective ways to target assistance is crucial to preventing multiple and protracted crises.  **What is food insecurity?**  Acute food insecurity is faced by people who are unable to afford or access essential food needs, and presents the risks of malnutrition, starvation or death. While the risk of food insecurity is greater for those in humanitarian crisis contexts, a humanitarian crisis does not have to be present for countries to experience high levels of food insecurity.   There are a number of metrics which indicate the overall level of food insecurity in a country: the absolute size of a population facing food insecurity; the size of a population facing food insecurity relative to the total population; and the intensity of the food insecurity felt by the population in need, as measured by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) acute food insecurity Phases 1-5.  IPC phases range from 1 to 5, where Phases 1 or 2 (minimal or stressed) indicate no immediate unmet food needs; and Phases 3, 4, and 5 (crisis, emergency and catastrophe/famine) indicate increasing severity of unmet food needs and the requirement for urgent assistance. The number of people in Phase 3 and above is a primary metric in tracking food insecurity, although the IPC does not cover every country every year. In 2022, the GRFC assessed 53 countries experiencing acute food insecurity and requiring external emergency assistance to cope. To produce a global total, other sources such as humanitarian needs assessments can be used to supplement IPC data, although these figures may use differing definitions of food security. For more information on calculating the number of people facing food insecurity in countries not covered by the IPC, see the methodology in the Appendix.  **The food insecurity gap**  Knowing the overall numbers of people facing food insecurity does not give a complete picture, as the intensity of food insecurity differs between populations, ranging from crisislevel (IPC Phase 3) to catastrophic levels or even famine (IPC Phase 5).  We can understand the difference in these levels as increasing gaps in food insecurity: populations with a greater gap ' or deeper food insecurity ' are experiencing more intense food insecurity and require a different and more urgent set of interventions.   Measuring how the intensity of food insecurity differs and changes between populations is vital to understanding and comparing levels of need, and tracking progress over time. To do this, we created a metric known as the 'food insecurity gap', a single percentage figure which indicates the intensity of food insecurity across a population. See the Appendix for more information on the methodology used to calculate this metric.   **How do we define humanitarian crisis?**  We define countries experiencing humanitarian crisis as those with a United Nations (UN)-coordinated humanitarian appeal. We identify countries facing protracted crisis as those with five or more consecutive years of UN-coordinated humanitarian appeals, while recurrent-crisis countries are those with two to four consecutive years of appeals. As of September 2022, there are 71 countries with UN-coordinated humanitarian appeals and 44 facing protracted crisis.","['Drought', 'Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Other']",['Food and Nutrition'],"['Afghanistan', 'Burkina Faso', 'Cameroon', 'Central African Republic', 'Colombia', 'Democratic Republic of the Congo', 'Ethiopia', 'Guatemala', 'Haiti', 'Honduras', 'Kenya', 'Malawi', 'Myanmar', 'Niger', 'Nigeria', 'Pakistan', 'Philippines', 'Somalia', 'South Sudan', 'Sri Lanka', 'Sudan', 'Syrian Arab Republic', 'Ukraine', 'Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)', 'World', 'Yemen']",Analysis
1730836,"**Highlights:**           - Affected populations in north east Nigeria remain in Emergency acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 4) due to large gaps in basic food needs and high levels of acute malnutrition.  - Over 97 per cent of 1.69 million children have been reached with Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV), 92 per cent of 1.61 million with Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) and 338,181 children (6 to 59 months) were screened for malnutrition in the recently completed integrated polio outbreak response and nutrition screening campaigns in Borno state.  - Over 2.7 million affected population have access to UNICEF supported primary healthcare services (PHC) and 89,178 severe acute malnourished children have been admitted into therapeutic feeding programmes with a cure rate of 87 per cent.  - With UNICEF support, 489,533 affected people have access to safe water. Psychosocial support has reached 155,962 children and 83,970 children are benefitting from education services through protective and safe learning environment.  -  Constraining factors to scale up humanitarian response include under-funding, access to affected people due to insecurity, and difficult road conditions exacerbated by heavy rains affecting aid delivery.  **Situation in Numbers**  29 Sept to 5 October 2016  14.8 million People affected by the crisis in the four North East States of Adamawa, Borno, Gombe and Yobe (HRP, January 2016)   7 million People in need in the four North East states. (HRP, January 2016)   3.8 million Children in need in the four North East states (HRP, January 2016)   2.2 million People in areas inaccessible due to insecurity in Borno (UNICEF Situation Analysis)    UNICEF Appeal 2016   US$ 115 million *Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC), does not include inaccessible areas of Borno   **Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs**  As more areas are cleared by military, increased number of displaced families are returning to their homes in newly accessible areas.   Field  mission  reports  from  various  humanitarian  partners  including  UN  partners  highlight  that  the  scale  of  damage  in  newly accessible  areas  is  immense  and  both  displaced  and  returning  families  continue  to  face  a  precarious  security  situation,  food shortages, economic disruption, as well as limited access to food, water and sanitation, shelter and health services in several recently accessible LGAs in Borno, Adamawa and Yobe States. The Nigeria Update from the Famine Early Warning Systems (FEWS) Network, reports that population in these areas remain in Emergency acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 4) as recent information shows larger gaps in basic food needs and suggest high levels of acute malnutrition. The Nigerian currency (Naira)has depreciated by more than 40 percent since early 2016, with the national inflation rate having increased from 17.1 per cent in July to 17.6 per cent presently, resulting in a significant increase in food prices,which is further exacerbating the food insecurity and malnutrition situation in crisis affected areas in north east.   Access for humanitarian actors to affected areas remains difficult. Sporadic attacks by the insurgentsalong some routes continue to  be a threat for civilian,  military and humanitarian  convoys.  Humanitarian organizations are providing  some support to these communities with helicopter services provided by the UN. The rainy season has also exacerbated the problem of access to some of these areas as roads are washed out and impassable.  A confirmed case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type two (cVDPV2) was discovered on 21 September in Monguno, a former non-accessible LGA of  Borno state, this follows  theAugust confirmation of three cases  of wild poliovirus. In response, UNICEF provided timely funds and support to the Ministry of Health to assess population immunity, search for cases of acute flaccid paralysis as part of polio surveillance, and assess any potential risk of circulation of this strain.   In newly accessible areas including Mafa, Konduga,  Dikwa, Bama, Monguno, Gowza, there is an urgent need to support the State Ministry of Education (SoME) and State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), with provision of school tents and other school supplies. The SoME has reported that in Konduga LGA, two more schools (Konduga Central Primary School and Lawan  Masta Primary School) have reopened and urgently require tents and supplies to increase access to safe learning. Additionally, school tents have been damaged due to heavy  rains  and  wind in a number  of IDP  camps  in Maiduguri and need  to  be replaced. This  has been  a consistent challenge and has often interrupted schooling.   UNICEF Country Representative, Chief of Field Office, and Health staff visited Muna Garage IDP Camp and Custom IDP camp Clinic in Maiduguri. There were significant improvements in terms of quality of services provided, showing good integration between health, WASH and nutrition.   With an  HIV/AIDs prevalence of 1.1% in  2014, Borno  state is not one of the priority states  for the national HIV/AIDs  response, however, the UNICEF HIV/AIDs Team is conducting a scoping mission (3 to 9 October) to assess the need  for a HIV response in affected areas in Borno state given the increased vulnerabilities to HIV/AIDs and the disruption of HIV/AIDs services in camps and among the displaced population.","['Drought', 'Other', 'Severe Local Storm']","['Contributions', 'Coordination', 'Education', 'Food and Nutrition', 'Health', 'Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding', 'Protection and Human Rights', 'Water Sanitation Hygiene']",['Nigeria'],Situation Report
3897773,"**THE GLOBAL COST OF LIVING CRISIS**  1 in 9 people around the world are supported by money that is sent to them by family or friends living in other countries. These are called remittances and they are a lifeline for millions, supporting household spending on things like food and energy.  Right now, the cost-of-living crisis is affecting many of us. From Beirut to Birmingham, people are struggling to cover the essentials and in March this year, global food prices in real terms reached an all-time high.  These issues are especially acute in the Horn of Africa. In Somalia, the price of milk, critical to child survival, rose by 140% in six months at the start of 2022.  Coupled with issues of importing grain and fertiliser due to the war in Ukraine, ongoing conflict, and the worst drought in 70 years, the country is facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity.  Right now, more than half of all children under 5 in Somalia are estimated to be suffering acute malnutrition. That's when your muscles begin to waste away, your vision blurs, your immune system becomes dangerously weak and eventually your organs shut down.  **HUMANITARIAN SUPPORT**  Against this backdrop, the UK has cut its support to Somalia, from £233 million in 2020, to £90 million so far in 2022.  Aid is lifesaving. It means humanitarian organisations like Save the Children can distribute peanut paste across rural communities to bring children back from the brink of death.  But aid is only a part of the picture and won't solve the long-term problems, the broken food system, the rising global temperatures and the ever-widening gap between rich and poor.  Remittances contribute a third of total GDP in Somalia, and amount to over three times the official development assistance and foreign direct investment worldwide. If UK remittances to Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia were free from costs for one year, £63 million more would go to families living there.  That's almost double the UN's response fund.  With yet another famine looming, now has to be a turning point for actually tackling these man-made choices, exacerbated by poor political choices.  **JOINING UP**  That's why, this month, we've launched a collaboration with four global remittance companies. Dahabshiill, Moneygram, Ria and Talk Remit. They are stepping up to reduce the fees they take when people are sending money to countries facing food insecurity.  It's a helpful short-term measure but longer-term solutions, where banks, Governments and development partners all step up to reduce the costs to remit need to be on the table. This would also help achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of reducing the cost of transferring money from 7% to 3% by 2030.  It's great to see four major companies step up to tackle the global hunger crisis in this way, and we call on others to join them.

3899684,"The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has embarked on a joint programme aimed at Strengthening Belize's crisis response systems and evidence base decision-making capabilities, through the application of sustainable and climate-smart water management in the rural farming ecosystem of Belize.  The flooding as a result of the heavy rains associated with Hurricane Julia highlighted the vulnerability of small-scale and women farmers in the rural areas of Belize and the necessity of developing innovative mitigating water management instruments.  The programme developed by the UNESCO Office for the Caribbean is funded by the United Nations Joint Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG) Fund and implemented jointly with the Government of Belize, FAO, WFP, and UNICEF. It aims to assist Belize in furthering its national strategies for rural resilience against food and water insecurities and extremes, threats exacerbated by climate variability, biodiversity erosion and global crisis. The project utilizes a gender perspective, which ascertains sex disaggregated information to fully comprehend water management in the agricultural sector.   Dr Anna Paolini, Director and Representative of the UNESCO Office for the Caribbean, highlights that 'through this Joint Programme, UNESCO and its sister agencies WFP, FAO and UNICEF, aims to deliver a water and gender case study towards strengthening Belize's resilience to food crisis'.  Indeed, in Belize the impacts of COVID-19, climate change, and of exogenous crisis showed that disruptions to livelihoods and incomes, as well as water-food poverty were widespread in the rural landscape. With 30% of females registered as farmers, being responsible for making choices on all aspects of their farms, and more than 25% of women employed in irrigation and water management, the rural women's communities in Belize are among the most affected. The larger effect of women farmers poverty in the society is commensurate to the fact that female-headed households make up to 40% of all households in most of the Caribbean small developing states.  The operational phase of the UNESCO project began with a training workshop in Belize City for government staff working in the fields of rural development, agriculture, and water resources. This workshop featured the methodology and use of the tool, designed by UNESCO, to collect and analyse sex-disaggregated data and information in the water-agriculture sector. The training was followed by fieldworks, which have deployed water data collection and key informant interviews for quantitative and qualitative sectoral representation in various rural communities of the Orange Walk District.  At the opening of the workshop, a number of senior officials gave their appreciation of the project and its objectives. Ms Arreini Palacio Morgan, Secretary General of the Belize National Commission for UNESCO, stated that ""the UNESCO project to promote water management by rural women farmers is innovative and drives contemplation on how to best position the gender component of development into the water management strategy of the country"".  ""Water is everybody's business"", according to Dr Victoriano Pascual, the Chief Agricultural Officer at the Ministry of Agriculture, Food Security, and Enterprise. Who further stated ""water is one part of the equation that will help us to maintain food security and ensure sustainability of Belize agri-food system'.  When reaffirming the importance of the inclusion of gender indicators in water management, plans and strategies, Mrs Tenielle Hendy, Principal Hydrologist for the National Hydrological Service, Ministry of Natural Resources, Mining and Petroleum, asserted that 'There is a need to focus not only on science of water but also how it affects the social aspect, like the past two themes for world water day, in water management we cannot afford to leave no one behind and we absolutely need to make the invisible, visible.  This workshop is highlighting to us the aspects of water management that are often invisible to becoming visible so that we can truly say we are managing water comprehensively and holistically'.  Dr Jean-Paul Ngome Abiaga, Head of the Natural and Ocean Sciences Programme in the UNESCO Office for the Caribbean, indicated that the outcomes of the project will serve to close existing gaps in Belize's water-food nexus, empower rural women farmers, and inform the design of programmes on resilience of the farming ecosystem, including vis-à-vis water extremes.  During the field execution in Orange Walk District, which ended October 21, 2022, the Rural Development Coordination Officers, the experts of the Ministry of Agriculture, and of the Ministry of Natural Resources, who participated in the implementation of this UNESCO programme declared that 'the field execution of the programme was an interesting experience, which gave them the opportunity to practice and mature the methodology on gender-related data and information collection. This exercise will certainly be beneficial to local rural communities and generate more women-related projects'.  The project will continue until December 31, 2022.","['Epidemic', 'Tropical Cyclone']","['Agriculture', 'Climate Change and Environment', 'Water Sanitation Hygiene']",['Belize'],News and Press Release

The following report describes activity between March and August 2021, based on monthly and special bulletins published by the Instituto Nicaragüense de Estudios Territoriales (INETER) and satellite images.  According to INETER, the volcano was quiet during March through 21 April, when two small gas-and-ash explosions occurred on that date at 0527 and 0610. Ash rose about 400 m above the crater and fell on the volcano's slopes. Satellite images during the last week of April showed dark emissions.  On 1 May 2021 a Sentinel-2 satellite image showed a weak ash plume extending W over the crater. Weak ash plumes were also recorded by Sentinel-2 on 3 May and 6 May. Then, according to INETER, a total of 60 weak explosions occurred during 6-8 May. The plumes reached a height of 300 m and drifted S and SW, with ash falling primarily on the volcano's slopes (figure 56). Sentinel-2 images showed weaker dark emissions through the rest of May. INETER reported 19 more weak explosions during 16-17 May and 16 explosions on 22 May, starting at 0508. On 24 May, 15 new explosions occurred, averaging once every 15 minutes. Gas-and-ash columns reached 250 m above the crater, and tephra from the plumes dropped back into the crater. After the activity on 5 May, INETER scientists visited the volcano and observed strong degassing (figure 57).  According to INETER, on 20-21 June, four small gas and ash explosions occurred. Ash rose to a maximum height of 150 m above the crater and fell on the NW slope. Sentinel-2 images recorded only modest emissions during these explosions, including a dark plume extending S on 25 June (figure 58). INETER reported that on 29 June gas-and-ash emissions began at 0500, with ash reaching a maximum height of about 200 m above the crater and falling on the SW slope.  The Washington Volcanic Ash Advisory Center (VAAC) reported ash plumes during 2-3 July. A few discrete emissions and ash near the crater were visible in webcam images on 2 July, and possible diffuse ash near and W of the crater was identified in satellite images. Plumes likely rose to about 200-500 m above the crater. Another steam-and-ash plume drifted SW and then turned N. On 3 July possible ash plumes rose about 500 m above the crater and drifted WSW. Sentinel-2 imagery showed an ash plume within the crater on 20 July. No additional ash plumes were detected or reported through August.  *Additional observations.* According to INETER, SO2 emissions measured with Mobile-DOAS using 7-8 transects ranged from an average of 47 metric tons/day (April) to 286 metric tons/day (August). The monthly values were generally lower during the first half of 2021 compared to March-December 2020 (figure 59). Seismic activity diminished every month between April (85,198 seismic events) and July (47,762 events), continuing a decreasing trend from January 2021 (about 140,000 seismic events). Most events during April-July were hybrid earthquakes. Tremor was 50-70 RSAM units in March and 10-30 RSAM units during April-July.  *Geological Summary.* Telica, one of Nicaragua's most active volcanoes, has erupted frequently since the beginning of the Spanish era. This volcano group consists of several interlocking cones and vents with a general NW alignment. Sixteenth-century eruptions were reported at symmetrical Santa Clara volcano at the SW end of the group. However, its eroded and breached crater has been covered by forests throughout historical time, and these eruptions may have originated from Telica, whose upper slopes in contrast are unvegetated. The steep-sided cone of Telica is truncated by a 700-m-wide double crater; the southern crater, the source of recent eruptions, is 120 m deep. El Liston, immediately E, has several nested craters. The fumaroles and boiling mudpots of Hervideros de San Jacinto, SE of Telica, form a prominent geothermal area frequented by tourists, and geothermal exploration has occurred nearby.  *Information Contacts:* *Instituto Nicaragüense de Estudios Territoriales (INETER)*, Apartado Postal 2110, Managua, Nicaragua (URL:  ); *MIROVA (Middle InfraRed Observation of Volcanic Activity)*, a collaborative project between the Universities of Turin and Florence (Italy) supported by the Centre for Volcanic Risk of the Italian Civil Protection Department (URL:  ); *Hawai'i Institute of Geophysics and Planetology (HIGP) - MODVOLC Thermal Alerts System*, School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST), Univ. of Hawai'i, 2525 Correa Road, Honolulu, HI 96822, USA (URL:  ); *NASA Global Sulfur Dioxide Monitoring Page*, Atmospheric Chemistry and Dynamics Laboratory, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA/GSFC), 8800 Greenbelt Road, Goddard MD, USA (URL:  ); *Sentinel Hub Playground* (URL:  ); *Washington Volcanic Ash Advisory Center (VAAC)*, Satellite Analysis Branch (SAB), NOAA/NESDIS OSPO, NOAA Science Center Room 401, 5200 Auth Rd, Camp Springs, MD 20746, USA (URL:  ).",['Volcano'],,['Nicaragua'],News and Press Release

3899847,"**559 million children currently exposed to high heatwave frequency, rising to all 2.02 billion children globally by 2050**  **UNICEF warns urgent action is needed to increase funding for adaptation to protect children and vulnerable communities from worsening heatwaves and other climate shocks.**  **LONDON/NEW YORK, 25 October, 2022** ' 559 million children are currently exposed to high heatwave frequency\*, according to new research from UNICEF. Further, 624 million children are exposed to one of three other high heat measures - high heatwave duration, high heatwave severity or extreme high temperatures.  During a year in which heatwaves in both the southern and northern hemispheres broke records, [*The Coldest Year Of The Rest Of Their Lives: Protecting Children From The Escalating Impacts Of Heatwaves *]( ) highlights the already extensive impact of heatwaves on children and reveals that, even at lower levels of global heating, in just three decades, more regular heatwaves are unavoidable for children everywhere.  The report estimates that by 2050, all of the world's 2.02 billion children are expected to be exposed to **high heatwave** **frequency**, regardless of whether the world achieves a 'low greenhouse gas emission scenario' with an estimated 1.7 degrees of warming in 2050 or a 'very high greenhouse gas emission scenario' with an estimated 2.4 degrees of warming in 2050.  Produced in collaboration with The Data for Children Collaborative and launched in partnership with UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador Vanessa Nakate and Africa-based Rise Up Movement, these findings underscore the urgent need to adapt the services children rely on as unavoidable impacts of global heating unfold. It also makes a case for continued mitigation, to prevent the worst impacts of the other high heat measures, including sustained and severe heatwaves and extreme high temperatures.  'The mercury is rising and so are the impacts on children,' UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said. 'Already, 1 in 3 children live in countries that face extreme high temperatures and almost 1 in 4 children are exposed to high heatwave frequency, and it is only going to get worse. More children will be impacted by longer, hotter and more frequent heatwaves over the next thirty years, threatening their health and wellbeing. How devastating these changes will be depends on the actions we take now. At a minimum, governments must urgently limit global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius and double adaptation funding by 2025. This is the only way to save children's lives and futures ' and the future of the planet.'  Heatwaves are especially damaging to children, as they are less able to regulate their body temperature compared to adults. The more heatwaves children are exposed to, the greater the chance of health problems including chronic respiratory conditions, asthma, and cardiovascular diseases. Babies and young children are at the greatest risk of heat-related mortality. Heatwaves can also affect children's environments, their safety, nutrition and access to water, and their education and future livelihood.  The report found **high heatwave** **duration** currently impacts 538 million, or 23 per cent of, children globally. This will rise to 1.6 billion children in 2050 at 1.7 degrees warming, and 1.9 billion children at 2.4 degrees warming, emphasising the importance of urgent and dramatic emissions mitigation and adaptation measures to contain global heating and protect lives.  Millions more children will be exposed to **high heatwave** **severity** and **extreme high temperatures** depending on the degree of global heating reached. Children in northern regions, especially Europe, will face the most dramatic increases in high severity heatwaves and, by 2050, nearly half of all children in Africa and Asia will face sustained exposure to extreme high temperatures.  Currently 23 countries fall into the highest category for child exposure to extreme high temperatures. This will rise to 33 countries by 2050 under the low emissions scenario and 36 countries under the very high emissions scenario. Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Niger, Sudan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, India and Pakistan are among the countries likely to remain in the highest category in both scenarios.  'The climate shocks of 2022 provided a strong wakeup call about the increasing danger hurtling towards us,' said Vanessa Nakate, climate activist and UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. 'Heatwaves are a clear example. As hot as this year has been in almost every corner of the world, it will likely be the coldest year of the rest of our lives. The dial is being turned up on our planet and yet our world leaders haven't begun to sweat. The only option is for us to continue to turn up the heat - on them - to correct the course we are on. World leaders must do this at COP27 for children everywhere, but especially the most vulnerable children in the most affected places. Unless they take action, and soon, this report makes it clear that heatwaves will become even harsher than they are already destined to be.'  UNICEF is calling on governments to:  - **PROTECT children from climate devastation by adapting social services.** Every country must adapt critical social services - water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), health, education, nutrition, social protection and child protection ' to protect children and young people. For example, food systems must be strengthened to withstand hazards and ensure continued access to healthy diets. Increased investments must be made in the early prevention, detection and treatment of severe malnutrition in children, mothers and vulnerable populations. At COP27, children and their rights must be prioritized in decisions on adaptation.  - **PREPARE children to live in a climate-changed world.** Every country must provide children and young people with climate change education, disaster risk reduction education, green skills training and opportunities to meaningfully participate and influence climate policy making. COP27 must see countries strengthen the focus on children's climate education and empowerment in the ACE action plan, adopt it, and implement previous commitments to build youth capacity.  - **PRIORITIZE children and young people in climate finance and resources.** Developed countries must deliver on their COP26 agreement to double adaptation funding to $40bn per year by 2025 at a minimum, as a step to delivering at least $300bn per year for adaptation by 2030. Adaptation funding must make up half of all climate finance. COP27 must unlock progress on loss and damage, placing the resilience of children and their communities at the center of discussions on action and support.   - **PREVENT a climate catastrophe by drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions and keep 1.5 degrees Celsius alive**. Emissions are projected to rise by 14% this decade, putting us on a path to catastrophic global heating. All governments must revisit their national climate plans and policies to increase ambition and action. They must cut emissions by at least 45% by 2030 to keep heating to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.  **Media contacts**  Tess Ingram      UNICEF New York      Tel: +1 347 593 2593     Email:","['Drought', 'Heat Wave', 'Wild Fire']","['Climate Change and Environment', 'Food and Nutrition', 'Health', 'Protection and Human Rights', 'Water Sanitation Hygiene']",['World'],Analysis

3901028,"The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) announced on Friday that the number of measles infections has increased to 11 as of 27 October 2022 in the Greater Sekhukhune District, Limpopo.  This comes after the NICD declared a measles outbreak after three cases from two healthcare facilities were reported in the same district early this month.  'The ages of the measles confirmed cases ranged from nine months to 24 years, with four males and four females,' the public health institute's statement read.   According to the data, of the latest infections, three children were fully vaccinated for measles, while two cases had unknown vaccination histories.  In addition, two children had not been jabbed against the viral infection.   'One measles case was hospitalised and another developed pneumonia without hospitalisation.'  Limpopo and Greater Sekhukhune District health officials have since started public health response activities with the support of the NICD and the World Health Organisation (WHO).  These activities, according to the NICD, include evaluating medical records to identify missing measles cases, contact tracing, screening for suspected measles and collecting blood and throat swabs for measles diagnostic tests.  The NICD has reminded citizens that measles patients present with fever, rash, and one or more of these symptoms, cough, red eyes, and runny nose.  In addition, complications of measles include pneumonia, diarrhoea, dehydration, encephalitis, blindness and death.  The NICD explained that measles complications are severe in malnourished children and those infants under the age of two.  People of any age who are unvaccinated can catch measles and develop the disease.  Meanwhile, the NICD said clinicians and caregivers should be on alert for anyone presenting with the above symptoms and signs and check children's road-to-health booklets to ensure measles vaccinations are up to date.  Measles vaccines are given routinely at six and 12 months of age.  'It is never too late to vaccinate against measles.' ' ** **",['Epidemic'],['Health'],['South Africa'],News and Press Release

1278596,"Regions in Papua New Guinea have been experiencing a significant drought over the past few months, with conditions likely to worsen. Megan Krolik, Disaster Risk Reduction Coordinator for the Pacific region, explains the situation.  'Currently in the Pacific, we're experiencing an El Niño event, is a cyclical weather phenomenon which occurs roughly every seven years. During an El Niño event, the western Pacific ' including countries such as Solomon Islands, Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Australia have less rainfall, more droughts, bushfires, hot temperatures, or extreme fluctuations in weather.  'At the moment, Papua New Guinea is experiencing a significant drought, and it is likely to worsen. It has been said that it is worse than the drought of 1997-1998, which also took place during an El Niño year and killed thousands of people due to a lack of food and water.' According to reports from the Government of Papua New Guinea, more than 1,842,000 people have already been affected by this extreme weather.  'Schools are closing because there's not enough water for children to be at schools, and children also have to help their families by going to find water in the afternoon,' said Megan. 'Some of the health clinics are also closed for half days because the nurses and the doctors also need to find water. There are reports of at least one hospital in the Highlands which has closed because there is not enough water to stay open.'  The drought has wide-reaching effects. As food sources have been depleting, insect infestations have increased and are targeting the remaining crops. There is also the increased risk of disease, as the lack of water means that people are unable to practice good hygiene and sanitation practices. It is also noted that the drought, which is mainly affecting the highland areas of Papua New Guinea, could force communities to move downwards closer towards the ocean. Such relocation could lead to tensions and conflict over access to land and resources.  'Indications suggest that the El-Nino could extend well in to 2016,' said Megan. 'But even if the drought breaks early next year, farmers won't be able to replant until the next sowing season, or until the rains return, so it will be at least six months to a year until the food gardens start replenishing and crops return to normal. For root crops such as sweet potato, a PNG staple, it could take up to two years to fully recover.'  **Preparing for a worsening situation**  With the expectation of a worsening situation, Caritas Australia has been working with our partner, Caritas Papua New Guinea, and the most affected Dioceses in Papua New Guinea, to begin preparations for an emergency response.  During a one day workshop in Mt Hagen facilitated by Caritas Papua New Guinea, Caritas Australia and Caritas Aotearoa New Zealand, representatives from four different dioceses in the Highlands gathered to discuss the current situation in each of their districts. They identified which areas were hardest hit, and at high risk. The participants also took part in a mapping exercise to identify what assets or resources they already had in their community which would help them through the drought.  The assets they listed ranged from the mountains and the different trees that grow in the Highlands, to crops that they hadn't previously considered to be drought resistant', said Megan.  'They even identified the 'Highland spirit' as what makes Highlanders, Highlanders. That kind of inner strength, practical-ness, back-to-nature quality was constantly identified as important. Family and community associations were another resource, as well as the Catholic radio network ' even though it's only partially operational, the group still identified it as a valuable resource. The Highlands is also renowned as an agricultural hub and so the fertile soil of the Highlands was also acknowledged as another resource.'  This approach of identifying existing assets or resources gives communities something they can start working with. 'People are always surprised about assets,' said Megan. 'So when we started talking about it, the group were incredibly invigorated by the idea that they had heaps of assets…. It shifted the thinking a little ' from a position of 'this is taking things away from us' to 'somethings have been taken, but other things are still there'.'  Caritas Australia is working closely with Caritas Papua New Guinea to develop a program that will provide support to communities during the drought. Caritas Australia is also responding through the existing Church Partnerships Program (CPP), which aims to strengthen the institutional capacity of the seven main PNG churches to deliver services to communities.   - [Donate to the Emergency Response Fund]( )  - [Learn more about our work in Papua New Guinea]( )","['Cold Wave', 'Drought', 'Insect Infestation']","['Agriculture', 'Education', 'Food and Nutrition', 'Health', 'Water Sanitation Hygiene']",['Papua New Guinea'],News and Press Release

1019151,"**OVERVIEW**   Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) experience a range of natural hazards, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tsunamis, landslides, volcanoes, forest fires, and droughts. El Niño and La Niña, extreme phases of natural climate cycles, periodically exacerbate the impacts of hydrometeorological events in the LAC region.   Environmental degradation and poor land-use management also increase populations' vulnerability to natural hazards.   USAID/OFDA supports DRR programs that save lives, alleviate human suffering, and reduce the social and economic impact of disasters in LAC. These programs include risk identification, prioritization, and reduction, as well as integration of DRR into post-disaster recovery and short-term rehabilitation projects. The focus of DRR funding in LAC is to enhance local and national self-sufficiency in disaster preparedness and management throughout the region. To this end, many of USAID/OFDA's programs strengthen the capacity of established national and regional disaster management institutions to meet the majority of emergency needs after a catastrophic event.    Established in 1989, the Regional Disaster Assistance Program (RDAP) is the primary vehicle for USAID/OFDA's support to manage disaster risk in LAC. USAID/OFDA's team of five regional advisors based in San José, Costa Rica, and a consultant network of 20 disaster risk management specialists dispersed throughout the region oversee and monitor RDAP programs. Since its inception, RDAP has improved the emergency response capacity of disaster management personnel and governments in LAC countries. Over time, USAID/OFDA support has shifted from a strictly instructional approach to providing technical assistance for planning, strengthening, and centralizing the role of national organizations in disaster management. Through RDAP, USAID/OFDA has expanded local and regional capabilities, improved intra- and inter-governmental coordination, and strengthened disaster preparedness, mitigation, and risk management activities.  - In addition to the regional office in Costa Rica, USAID/OFDA maintains a field office in Haiti—comprising two program officers—that works to build the capacity of the Government of Haiti to prepare for and respond to disasters and supports community-based preparedness and urban DRR activities.  - USAID/OFDA supports DRR activities in LAC through a wide range of programs. In FY 2014, USAID/OFDA provided more than $24.5 million for DRR projects throughout LAC, including programs that integrate DRR with disaster response. The programs discussed herein include both programs funded in FY 2014, as well as ongoing programs funded in previous fiscal years.","['Drought', 'Earthquake', 'Epidemic', 'Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Tropical Cyclone', 'Tsunami', 'Volcano']","['Agriculture', 'Contributions', 'Disaster Management', 'Health', 'Protection and Human Rights']","['Barbados', 'Brazil', 'Chile', 'Colombia', 'Costa Rica', 'Dominican Republic', 'El Salvador', 'Guatemala', 'Haiti', 'Honduras', 'Jamaica', 'Nicaragua', 'Panama', 'Paraguay', 'Peru', 'United States of America', 'World']",Situation Report
3482003,"Saturday January 18, 2020  Heavy snowfall, torrential rain, avalanches and landslides have swept across the country, with the regions of Azad Jammu, Kashmir (AJK) and Baluchistan worst affected. At least 96 people have been killed and more than 130,000 families affected, isolating locals in remote parts of AJK. This figure is likely to increase as relief teams attempt to reach the worst affected areas.  With the worst snowfall for over 20 years, the minimum temperature in Quetta, Baluchistan has dropped to -11◦C. The nearby districts of Kalat and Ziarat have also recorded -10◦C and -13◦C as temperatures remain drastically low making families extremely vulnerable and in dire need of help.  The Islamic Relief team in Pakistan is coordinating with government agencies to gain access to isolated areas in the Neelum valley and across Baluchistan to provide urgent assistance. This will include safe drinking water, temporary shelters as well as immediate life-saving relief.  Heavier snowfall has been forecast over the next few days making relief efforts challenging and is likely to worsen the current emergency situation. The full extent of damage will be known in the coming days.  Islamic Relief has launched an emergency appeal for up to £2 million. The charity is working closely with local authorities to address the immediate needs of those affected and aims to reach the most vulnerable, such as those who are badly injured, disabled people, pregnant women, babies and the elderly.  Tufail Hussain, Director of Islamic Relief UK, said:  What we are witnessing is an unprecedented weather phenomenon, the likes of which hasn't been seen in this part of Pakistan for over 20 years. Communities have been isolated and homes destroyed due to avalanches. Thousands are now facing the elements without any kind of protection. Our teams are liaising with the National Disaster Management Authority to provide urgent assistance to the people affected by this disaster.   We have a very strong presence in Pakistan, having worked there since 1992. We have responded to countless disasters over the years. We are now determined to do as much as we can to help the survivors of this emergency. With worsening weather conditions predicted, this is a race against time to reach the worst affected communities.  In addition to supporting the rescue efforts, we will be delivering food, water and essential household items. We will also repair water systems so that people have access to safe water.  **ENDS**  For more info, photos and interviews in Pakistan and the UK contact Sultan Ahmed on  ; or call +44 207 5933 217, +7471 033 566","['Cold Wave', 'Snow Avalanche']","['Food and Nutrition', 'Shelter and Non-Food Items', 'Water Sanitation Hygiene']",['Pakistan'],News and Press Release

Fourteen eruptions have been documented since 1852, often with phreatic activity, including its most recent one that occurred during 7-8 July 2015; activity was characterized by a small, short-lived ash eruption (BGVN 41:02). This report updates information through September 2021 and includes a short eruption during July 2021, based on information from the Pusat Vulkanologi dan Mitigasi Bencana Geologi (PVMBG, also known as CVGHM, or the Center of Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation) and the Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Center (VAAC).  No significant activity has been reported since an ash plume on 7 and 8 July 2015. Low seismicity was recorded during April through June 2021; a minor increase in tremor amplitude lasted 10 hours on 21 July, though there were no volcanic earthquakes indicative of magma movement. However, the Volcano Alert Level was raised to 2 (on a scale of 1-4) later that day. Following this increase in seismicity, a phreatic eruption was recorded at 1644 through 1800 on 21 July, which produced a white-and-gray ash plume that rose 2 km above the summit and drifted N (figure 1). Weak, intermittent, white gas-and-steam emissions continued to rise up to 500 m above the summit through August, according to PVMBG; some gas-and-steam emissions were noted during September.  ***Geological Summary:*** Sirung volcano is located at the NE end of a 14-km-long line of volcanic centers that form a peninsula at the southern end of Pantar Island. The volcano is truncated by a 2-km-wide caldera whose floor often contains one or more small lakes. Much of the volcano is constructed of basaltic lava flows, and the Gunung Sirung lava dome forms the high point on the caldera's western rim. A number of phreatic eruptions have occurred from vents within the caldera during the 20th century. Forested Gunung Topaki, the high point of the volcanic chain, lies at the SW end and contains a symmetrical summit crater.  ***Information Contacts:*** *Pusat Vulkanologi dan Mitigasi Bencana Geologi (PVMBG, also known as Indonesian Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation, CVGHM),* Jalan Diponegoro 57, Bandung 40122, Indonesia (URL:  ); *Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC),* Bureau of Meteorology, Northern Territory Regional Office, PO Box 40050, Casuarina, NT 0811, Australia (URL:  ).",['Volcano'],,['Indonesia'],News and Press Release
3673752,"ACT Alliance has supported the communities that were affected by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami in September 2018 through its members in Indonesia. Two years later, we went back to the people we assisted to see how they have recovered.   The 7.5 magnitude earthquake in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, had disastrous consequences, as it also triggered a tsunami which hit the provincial capital of Palu. More than 4,300 people lost their lives, over 200,000 were displaced and nearly 70,000 houses destroyed. Many shops and other small businesses as well as the irrigation systems for family farms were destroyed, causing countless families to lose their incomes.  ACT Alliance members [Yakkum Emergency Unit (YEU)]( ), [Indonesian Christian Association for Health Service (ICAHS/PELKESI)]( ) and [Church World Service (CWS)]( ), with their partners coordinated, their responses through the ACT appeal, targeting 100,000 vulnerable people affected by the earthquake and tsunami. All three organisations supported the Sigi district in Central Sulawesi, which had one of the highest numbers of casualties caused by mudflows and liquefaction after the earthquake. Several aftershocks damaged more buildings and houses causing even more people to become homeless.  **More independence for people with disability**  One of the persons supported by ACT Alliance in the Sigi district is Sudirman (picture above right), a man who has lived in Ngatabaru all his life and is paralyzed from the waist down. He can inspire you with stories about his adventures as a driver for tourists before his sickness made it impossible for him to drive again six years ago. After that, it was difficult for Sudirman to move around his house -- even going to the toilet was an ordeal on his own. He needed a caretaker all the time.  Sudirman's house was damaged by the earthquake and he and his family had to live in the part of it which was relatively safe for them. YEU organized workers to help them build a new home specifically designed for people with disabilities. Sudirman and his wife assisted, supervising the work and selecting the materials used. With YEU's support, they could also learn new skills and earn some income while work was difficult to find. His new home allowed Sudirman better mobility which made him more independent. He and his family, in YEU trainings, learned more about how to manage his health issues. The house was completed in April 2019, and he has been living there ever since. ""I can now do things on my own without needing a caretaker with me all day, since I can move around the house without assistance. My family also knows how they can support me better while also enjoying their own lives"", he says.    **Focus on infrastructure as well as on psychological aspects**    Disasters often leave people traumatized as they have to handle their losses and recover from the fear they experienced. YEU trained schools and communities on psychosocial care and support while at the same time ensuring safe space and a protected environment to develop, learn, play and build resilience.   CWS provided water tanks and safe water during the early days after the disaster in Sigi while they as well as the government worked on repairing pipelines and improving water supply in the villages. The organisation also supported communities to set up Water Management Committees so that people could manage the water system themselves when the project ends. ""We now have enough clean water, without needing to worry about where to get it. Better still, we are managing the water system ourselves, so we know that when something goes wrong, we can fix it"", says Badrun, Committee member in Sikara Tobata village, Donggala district.  **Ensuring health services**   Maslia, a village health cadre from Enu, Donggala, received health training and support from PELKESI which she was grateful for since their health clinic was closed for several months after the disaster. PELKESI's mobile clinics with volunteer doctors and nurses provided the health services during this period, while the government health clinics were unable to do so as the staffs were affected by the disaster themselves. Health workers and villagers in the areas where PELKESI was active after the disaster learned about traditional health techniques, acupressure, and herbal medicine using local resources. Mothers were also taught how to cook food using local foodstuffs and herbal drinks from plants that they used to think of as weeds or useless, that can be found in their backyard.   PELKESI assisted the health cadres to get an official policy and budget to provide supplementary food for the infants and toddlers in ten villages (Simoro, Tuva, Sibalaya Utara, Sibalaya Barat, Pantoloan, Baiya, Enu, Lero Tatari, Desa Wani Satu, Desa Wani Dua) through a village grant. Before the earthquake and tsunami, there were only two villages which provided supplementary food cost for children. Now, through several discussions between health cadres and host governments, all ten villages have policies to provide budget for supplementary food for children. This achievement is particularly meaningful during the COVID-19 pandemic.  **New sources of income**  New ways to earn a living had to be found after the disasters. [Yohanes Rombe]( ) a year ago was able to plant corn, peppers, and other vegetables thanks to irrigation being available for the crops from a new well built by CWS. He has now been able to harvest a crop to feed himself and his family  Besides facilitating farming by building or re-establishing irrigation systems, CWS and its partners also collected new ideas from community members to restore or create opportunities to earn a living. These initiatives were initiated months before the outbreak of COVID-19, but later on also helped people to get through the lockdown. Introducing relevant safety measures, people could still run their local kiosks, do fish farming and drying, brown sugar milling, produce snacks and coconut oil for home use. ""We learnt how important it is for all of us to think of alternative ways to process and sell our local products. Why shouldn't we do something new with it?"", states Mirnawati from Lende Tovea village, Donggala district.  **How did COVID-19 change the situation?**  Due to the pandemic at the beginning of 2020, humanitarian response activities that were nearly done had to be slowed down or adapted. Prevention education needed to be prioritized, printing and distributing educational materials for families and leading public education and correct information sharing about the virus. ACT members adhere to health protocol as required in all of our interventions through several actions; did local radio broadcasting in Palu, introduced safety measures to staff and visitors in hospitals, were active on social media, and distributed face masks for the vulnerable groups (elderly, persons with disabilities and children). Although having to deal with COVID-19 represented an additional challenge to the disaster response, the ACT Alliance members are optimistic that they will reach the objectives of the appeal in the coming months.  What is needed for the future are educating communities on the importance of growing vegetables and fruits for food security, health trainings and hygiene promotions to prevent the local transmission of the virus, ensuring permanent safe-water (gravity-fed piped water systems and boreholes), livelihood supports for small and medium enterprises (including home-based business) and community-based disaster preparedness initiatives.

1843534,"East Asia and the Pacific region remains extremely prone to natural hazards, with significant human casualties and economic losses ' more than 40 million people were affected by disasters in 2015. Children are among the most vulnerable to natural hazards, and suffer short-term and long-lasting negative impacts on health, nutrition, protection and education. Population growth, rapid urbanization and climate change continue to exacerbate the impact of disasters, which are expected to occur more frequently and with greater intensely, and to impact larger populations in the coming years. This threatens the well-being and protection of vulnerable populations, especially children, and prevents them from realizing their full potential. In 2015 and 2016, El Niño led to irregular rainfall patterns, causing both severe drought and flooding, particularly in Indonesia, Mongolia, the Pacific sub-region, Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste and Viet Nam, affecting more than 10 million people. Typhoons and cyclones disrupted the lives of thousands of children in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Pacific sub-region and Viet Nam. In addition, ethnic strife and protracted conflicts in Myanmar and the Philippines continue to severely impact the survival and well-being of children and other vulnerable populations. In the Philippines, clashes between the Philippine Armed Forces, the Abu Sayyaf group in Basilan and the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters in Maguindanao continue to drive conflict-related displacement, with mounting concerns regarding grave violations of child rights.  **Regional humanitarian strategy**   The East Asia and the Pacific Regional Office (EAPRO) and UNICEF country offices work closely with national authorities to reach the most vulnerable children and their families and protect their rights during humanitarian situations. In response to recurrent monsoons and other disasters in the region, EAPRO will support country offices to deliver assistance to affected children, in line with the Core Commitments for Children in Humanitarian Action, particularly in the areas of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), nutrition, education and child protection. At the same time, UNICEF will continue to invest in its partnerships with national governments to strengthen capacities and systems in countries and contribute to national policy and strategy setting on preparedness and disaster risk reduction (DRR), based on child-centered risk assessment and vulnerability analysis. EAPRO will continue to build regional knowledge management capacity to document best practices and lessons learned to ensure regional exchange and make responses more fit for purpose in fast changing environments. Innovations such as cash transfers in emergencies are being piloted and further developed to support vulnerable groups affected by recurrent disasters. Committed to global agendas, including the World Humanitarian Summit, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Paris Climate Agreement, EAPRO will continue to work closely with its humanitarian partners and regional and sub-regional government bodies to nurture close collaboration and provide effective action for children, while addressing climate change, resilience and DRR. Acknowledging the increased capacity for emergency response among many governments in the region, EAPRO and country offices will rely on regional support mechanisms that draw expertise from and provide surge support to countries in the region by pooling available resources, advocating for improved humanitarian performance monitoring and encouraging further alignment of service delivery in humanitarian and development programmes.     **Results in 2016**   As of 31 October 2016, UNICEF had received US$8.46 million against the US$8.10 million appeal.2 These funds allowed EAPRO to support the effective delivery of humanitarian action in its 14 country offices, and ensure investment in preparedness and DRR. Funds accessed through the regional preparedness and response budget supported the response to El Niño-induced drought and flooding in Viet Nam, including the distribution of therapeutic foods and micronutrients to pregnant and lactating women and children aged 6 to 23 months. Critical WASH supplies were delivered to affected families, with additional supplies en route. In response to Tropical Cyclone Winston, the UNICEF Office for the Pacific provided tents and education supplies to affected children, building on the achievements of ongoing development projects. In the Philippines, UNICEF concluded the Typhoon Haiyan response; one of its final contributions was to the development of the implementing regulation of the Children's Emergency Relief and Protection Act. EAPRO also enhanced country capacities through trainings on preparedness, response and DRR, and initiated knowledge management mechanisms to mitigate the impact of recurrent disasters. EAPRO is also an active DRR partner and in 2016 contributed to child and youth coalitions, preparedness/DRR platforms and inter-governmental events, and initiatives such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Agreement on Disaster Management and Emergency Response and the Asia Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction.","['Drought', 'Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Storm Surge', 'Tropical Cyclone']","['Disaster Management', 'Education', 'Food and Nutrition', 'Protection and Human Rights', 'Water Sanitation Hygiene']","['Cambodia', 'China', ""Democratic People's Republic of Korea"", 'Fiji', 'Indonesia', 'Malaysia', 'Myanmar', 'Papua New Guinea', 'Philippines', 'Thailand', 'Timor-Leste', 'Viet Nam', 'World']",Appeal

' Clean drinking water supply and environmental clean-up are among the priority humanitarian needs initially expressed.  ' UNICEF is mobilizing emergency supplies prepositioned in the Australian humanitarian warehouse in Brisbane and the UNICEF warehouse in Fiji for immediate deployment to Tonga.  **Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs**  Three days after the explosive eruption that triggered a tsunami, the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Taa'pai volcano in Tonga appears to be simmering down as the volcanic activity has been downgraded to Alert Level 3, meaning that eruption hazards are now confined near its vent. Communications to Tonga are still a challenge. While local telecommunications within the main island of Tongatapu have been restored, overseas communications still depend on a few satellite phones operating in the island. Early reports describe substantial ash coverage around Nuku'alofa, inundation of coastal areas and damage to some infrastructure. Two casualties were confirmed. While damage to agriculture is less than what was feared, concerns about water supply, air quality and availability of fuel have been raised. Outbreak of waterborne diseases is also feared as tidal surges caused flooding 2-3 blocks inland. Aerial surveillance showed significant infrastructure damage to small islands in the Haapai group, north of the capital. The main airport in the capital is not yet operational as the ash covering the runaway is still being cleared. Repatriation flights from New Zealand and Fiji have also been cancelled because of the ash cloud.   Entry to Tonga remains restricted because of COVID-19 protocols.","['Flood', 'Tsunami', 'Volcano']","['Coordination', 'Education', 'Food and Nutrition', 'Health', 'Logistics and Telecommunications', 'Shelter and Non-Food Items', 'Water Sanitation Hygiene']","['Fiji', 'Samoa', 'Tonga']",Situation Report

The consultations ' facilitated by Save the Children and running from May to July' involve a mix of face-to-face meetings, online surveys and Zoom calls to ask children questions about the climate crisis and inequality and their opinion on what adults should do to tackle this.  Over 3,500 children in Egypt, 3,000 in the UK, 3,000 in Indonesia, 1,200 in Nepal, 1,100 in Norway and 500 in Malawi have already participated in the consultations, alongside hundreds of children in Lebanon, Kenya and South Africa and other countries.  When completed, tens of thousands of children across more than 30 countries will have shared their views, making the consultation one of the largest of its kind, in the number of children reached and countries covered. The results will be shared in a global report to be released in October.  With the Horn of Africa facing its worst drought in a lifetime, Britain and parts of Europe seeing hottest days on record this month, wildfires raging across parts of France, Portugal, Spain and Greece, and floods in parts of South Asia and Australia, the feedback from children couldn't be more urgent.  Children affected by inequality and discrimination, such as those from lower-income families or refugee communities, are more at risk of the impacts of climate change, Save the Children said. They are most likely to lack access to quality healthcare, have underlying health conditions or be malnourished, and their families are least likely to be able to afford damage caused to livelihoods and homes.

3777423,"**Climate Crisis ' Children face life with far more heatwaves, floods, droughts and wildfires than grandparents**  Children born over the past year\[1\] will on average face seven times more scorching heatwaves during their lives than their grandparents under original Paris Agreement emission reduction pledges.  This is according to new research released by Save the Children in collaboration with an international team of climate researchers led by the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), and also published in the renowned journal [*Science*]( ).  In Afghanistan alone, children could face up to 18 times as many heatwaves as their elders.  Newborns across the globe will on average also live through 2.6 times more droughts, 2.8 times as many river floods, almost three times as many crop failures, and twice the number of wildfires as people born 60 years ago if emissions were to follow the original Paris Agreement pledges.  Children born in Mali could be facing up to 10 times as many crop failures as their grandparents.  Some children might even be hit by several of these disasters simultaneously or in quick succession ' exacerbating the effects even further.  Children living in lower-and middle-income countries, as well as in disadvantaged communities, will be worst affected as they are already at far greater risk from waterborne diseases, hunger, and malnutrition, and their homes are often more vulnerable to increased risks from floods, cyclones and other extreme weather events.   Moreover, these climate impacts risk trapping millions more children into long-term poverty and threaten to undo decades of progress in the fight against hunger and stunting.  The data is part of the organisation's new report [*Born into the Climate Crisis: Why we must act now to secure children's rights*]( ), and highlights the lifetime exposure to a range of extreme climate-related events on children born in 2020 compared to people born in 1960. The report also outlines the devastating impact of the climate crisis on children if urgent action is not taken, and features first-hand accounts from children in 11 countries on how climate change is impacting their lives, as well as recommendations on how to fight it.  Under the original Paris Agreement emission reduction pledges, global temperatures will rise by an estimated 2.6 to 3.1 degrees above pre-industrial levels—which would have an unacceptable impact on children, Save the Children said.  Under these pledges, children born in 2020 will face on average twice as many wildfires, 2.8 times more crop failures, 2.6 times more droughts, 2.8 times more river floods, and 6.8 times as many heatwaves during their lives than people born in 1960.  The organisation emphasised there is still time to turn this bleak future around. If warming is limited to 1.5 degrees, the additional lifetime exposure of newborns to heatwaves will drop by 45%; by 39% for droughts; by 38% for river floods; by 28% for crop failures, and by 10% for wildfires.  Aslam, 8, lives with his widowed mother in a Rohingya camp in Bangladesh, where floods have regularly hit over the past months. As their shelter flooded up to their waists, they lost all of their food and had to flee to higher ground. They returned to their shelter, but as the floor was still wet and muddy, they could not cook or sleep there.  *'When the floodwaters entered our house, we went up to the hill. Our food, stove, clothes are all wet. We can't stay at our house because of the wet soil. If the house is rebuilt, we will be able to stay in the house again. We can't cook rice in the house. Now I will go to \[a distribution point\] for food. I will bring food from there and then eat.'*  Chatten, 16, was just 8 years old when his home in the Philippines was destroyed by Typhoon Haiyan—one of the most powerful [tropical cyclones](  ""Tropical cyclone"") ever recorded—which devastated the country in 2013. Seeing the impacts of climate change first-hand inspired Chatten to become a climate activist, and he now campaigns with Save the Children. He said:   *""I've seen the effects of climate change with my own eyes. Typhoon Haiyan destroyed thousands of homes where I live and left many of my friends, relatives, classmates and other people homeless. Even before that, we were already experiencing a lot of climate-related disasters in my region, and each year it gets worse. In recent years we've had a drought, extreme heat waves and landslides caused by heavy rains. The months that are supposed to be sunny have become rainy, and the months that are supposed to be rainy are sunny.*  *To think that children born today will live through even more cyclones, heat waves and other disasters than our grandparents makes me feel sad. Children have contributed least to the climate crisis and yet we're the ones who will suffer the most.""*  Inger Ashing, CEO of Save the Children International, said: *'Our report shows the terrifying reality for this generation and future ones if we don't act now.*  *'Children in low- and middle-income countries and disadvantaged communities will be the worst affected, but every child will feel the ravaging impact of this climate emergency.*  *'The recent heatwaves in the US and Canada, the wildfires in Australia, the recent floods in Europe and China, the multiple droughts, which are driving food crises in places such as Afghanistan, Madagascar, and Somalia, have clearly shown that nowhere is safe. Without urgent action, we will be handing over a deadly future to our children.'*  The report also reveals that:  -   The impacts of climate change disrupt children's access to healthcare and education, especially for the already disadvantaged — such as girls, children in refugee communities, children with disabilities and Indigenous children. In Pakistan, for example, after the 2010 floods—made worse by climate change—24% of girls in Grade 6 dropped out of school, compared to 6% of boys\[2\]. -   While children in North America and Western Europe are unlikely to suffer more crop failures, for example, newborns in sub-Saharan Africa will face 2.6 times more crop failures than their elders, and children in the Middle East and North Africa up to 4.4 times more.  Ms Ashing continued: *'The climate crisis is a child rights crisis at its core. We need to scrap our dependency on fossil fuels, set up financial safety nets and support the hardest hit people. We can turn this around ' but we need to listen to children and jump into action. If warming is limited to 1.5 degrees, there is far more hope of a bright future for children who haven't even been born yet.'*  Save the Children said that action on climate change is not only a moral obligation but also a legal one for governments to act in the best interests of children.  Despite this, children are routinely left out of key decisions on the issue, even though it affects their lives most, and for decades to come. Children need to play a key role in decisions on climate change, particularly those impacted by inequality and discrimination, the organisation said. Governments not only need to listen to children but also act upon their recommendations.  Laura, 16, from Chile, said in the report: *'We will do our part, raising awareness among our peers, and close adults so that they recognize the problem and become aware of it because alone we will not be able to achieve it. We need joint work and real support from adults, even more so \[from\] the decision-makers, because today we are at risk \[…\] and without action, we will not have tomorrow.'*  To limit the impact of climate change on the lives of millions of children, Save the Children is calling for: a limit on global warming to 1.5 degrees, including by rapidly phasing out fossil fuels; an increase in climate financing to help children and communities adapt to the climate crisis; put children's voices, demands and rights at the centre of climate commitments; and invest in safety nets for children and families threatened by the climate crisis.

[Full report available here]( )  Notes to editors:  Climate researchers led by the Vrije Universiteit Brussels used five sources of data: newly-generated global-scale simulations of climate impacts across six extreme event categories; life expectancy data from the United Nations World Population Prospects; global mean temperature scenarios compiled in support of the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius; gridded population reconstructions and projections; and country-scale cohort size data provided by the Wittgenstein Centre's Human Capital Data Explorer.  The research calculates the exposure of an average person to climate impacts across their lifetime in 178 countries, 11 regions and the globe, then compares different age groups to calculate conservative estimates of lifetime extreme event occurrence as a consequence of climate change, while controlling for changes in life expectancy. The study defines current policies as the climate pledges outlined in each state's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) following the Paris Agreement and in this content considers a scenario with a global mean temperature increase of 2.4°C by 2100. The methods and results are documented in detail in a scientific publication published today in the renowned journal, [*Science*]( ).  Save the Children's report was developed with the support of a Child Reference Group, made up of 12 children aged between 12-17 years old from Albania, Bangladesh, Chile, El Salvador, Guatemala, Kosovo, Norway, Somalia, Sri Lanka, the United States, and Zambia. The children laid out how the impacts of intergenerational climate change are infringing on their rights to life, education, and protection.  * * *  \[1\] The research compared children born in 2020 to people born in 1960  \[2\]  *Women, girls and disasters ' A Review for DFID*.

3892394,"MANILA, 29 September 2022 ' Gerd Müller, Director General of the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), and Carlos D. Sorreta, Undersecretary for Multilateral and International Economic Relations at the Philippines Department of Foreign Affairs, met to discuss further strengthening of cooperation and sign a Joint Declaration.  The document touches on a number of shared priorities, which sit high on the agendas of both the Philippines government and UNIDO. Food security is among them, and the two discussed ways to increase the productivity of agriculture and fisheries - both very important productive sectors in the country - and how to further integrate Filipino food produce into global value chains.  Director General Müller and Undersecretary Sorreta also agreed on the importance of renewable energy and industrial energy efficiency in fast-developing countries such the Philippines. In this context, there is a common focus on finding avenues to mainstream innovative and affordable technologies appropriate to the local context. Director General Müller expounded on UNIDO's new motto: Progress by innovation.  Another area for strengthened cooperation is adaptation to climate change and environmental protection. The Philippines is the one of the countries most at risk from the climate crisis. In recent years, extreme weather events, such as tropical cyclones and heavy monsoon rain, have triggered disastrous floods and landslides. Just days before Müller arrived in Manila, a super typhoon hit the north-western Philippines, forcing thousands out of their homes and leaving many towns underwater.   Lastly, Sorreta and Müller discussed how to facilitate the inflow of finance and investment in national manufacturing, as well as the transfer of advanced technologies to Filipino small and medium enterprises, which are the country's economic backbone.  Müller highlighted how the Joint Declaration is a framework to bolster UNIDO's cooperation with the Philippines and further advance SDG9 and inclusive and sustainable industrial development.  The meeting marked the beginning of celebrations of the 30th anniversary of the basic co-operation agreement, signed in 1993, which serves as the foundation of cooperation between the Philippines and UNIDO.","['Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Tropical Cyclone']","['Agriculture', 'Climate Change and Environment', 'Food and Nutrition']",['Philippines'],News and Press Release
3724407,"Wednesday March 24, 2021  Islamic Relief is scaling up to provide emergency shelter and sanitation to thousands of people made homeless by the devastating fire at Balukali refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh.  Around 10,000 shelters have been destroyed and almost 90,000 people affected. An emergency assessment by Islamic Relief and our local partner organisation, Uttaran, has found that thousands of people have been left without any latrines, washing facilities or clean water -- putting people at grave risk of disease outbreaks as the camp becomes increasingly congested.  Many of the homeless have been taken in by relatives or neighbours, and Islamic Relief teams on the ground say that conditions are now extremely cramped, with tents designed for four people now holding eight or nine. With two major wells destroyed, there are long queues of people waiting for hours to get water.  Islamic Relief, in coordination with local authorities, will provide almost 6,000 people with emergency tents, latrines, hygiene kits including face masks and Covid-19 protective material, and other items such as clothes and mosquito nets.  Akmal Shareef, Islamic Relief's Country Director in Bangladesh, says:   > *""Tens of thousands of people have lost everything they own. All they have left is the clothes they were wearing when the fire broke out. Many fled to Bangladesh with nothing as they escaped terrible violence and they have been trying to rebuild their lives here, only for the fire to destroy everything.* > > *""The level of destruction is devastating and will take a long time to recover. People are still in shock. Local community groups have been central to the emergency response but they need more support.""* > > *The camps at Cox's Bazar currently shelter more than 870,000 Rohingya refugees.* > > *15 people are confirmed to have died in the fire so far, although there are fears that the numbers will rise.

3676498,"*\[The below article was originally published on Business Fights Poverty on 25 September 2020.\]*  *By Karen Smith, Programme Coordinator, Connecting Business initiative*  There were myriad situations where COVID-19 was an additional layer on pre-existing crises, ranging from natural hazards such as earthquakes and hurricanes to manmade crises such as the refugee crisis or conflict. How does such a 'confluence of crises' affect businesses, communities, and entire economies? In the experience of the Connecting Business initiative (CBi) ' a platform transforming the way the private sector engages before, during and after crises ' these situations drive home the importance the national private sector, resilience and preparedness, as well as collective action and collaboration as a critical part of local response.  What has also been reinforced during the pandemic is that investing in the preparedness and resilience of communities and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) as well as the private sector as a whole is an economic imperative.  For example, a [recent report]( ) by Business for Goals (B4G) in Turkey highlighted that the Marmara earthquake the country experienced 20 years ago claimed the lives of approximately 17,000 people and inflicted losses on more than 30,000 enterprises, causing economic damages of approximately USD 27 billion. An equivalent event today would likely cause larger losses still, a clear call to action to invest in the resilience of businesses of all sizes. Other [surveys]( ) by B4G on the impact of COVID-19 showed a significant impact on businesses and that Syrian-owned businesses were more significantly affected by the pandemic, with 38% of them declaring a full stop of operations compared to 22% of other businesses in the country.  Investing in community resilience and preparedness is essential for risk mitigation and effective disaster response. In Haiti, the Alliance pour la Gestion des Risques et la Continuité des Activités (AGERCA) network carried out campaigns built on information sharing through broad business networks, providing training around health and safety measures as well as distributing hygiene kits to contribute to community preparedness and mitigate risks. When Tropical Storm Laura hit, in an unfortunate example of a confluence of crises, AGERCA sent more than two million text messages and provided phone credit to the National Emergency Center to facilitate communications between departments. Now, preparedness interventions are combining COVID-19 information sharing and reminders about hurricane season.  In Sri Lanka, the Asia Pacific Alliance for Disaster Management Sri Lanka (A-PAD SL) network has taken a collective and collaborative approach, joining hands with HSBC Bank and other private sector partners to support government efforts by providing healthcare essentials and ration support to frontline workers, communities and the health sector. A-PAD Japan joined Sri Lanka's COVID-19 resistance efforts by offering solid support to the country in partnership with A-PAD Sri Lanka, providing an array of healthcare essentials to the Disaster Management Center (DMC).  The importance of collective action was also highlighted by efforts led by the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation (PDRF). As part of their activities during the pandemic, they collectively raised the equivalent of USD 30 million through [Project Ugnayan]( ), to fund the distribution of grocery vouchers to 14.2 million people in the poor communities of the greater Manila area. The network also recently launched the [SIKAP platform]( ), an online business recovery hub to help micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) prepare for COVID-19 recovery and reopen as they bounce forward to the 'next normal'.  In Vanuatu, the COVID-19 lockdown led to a scarcity in humanitarian personnel and resources which coincided [when]( ) Tropical Cyclone Harold struck. Working with private sector partners and in collaboration with NGOs and the United Nations (UN) and in support of the government, the Vanuatu Business Resilience Council (VBRC) assisted in supplying over 1,000 remote coastal households with 35 tonnes of food and non-food items over an eight-week period. This local multi-stakeholder response was critical in mitigating the impact and damages caused by the cyclone.  While the pandemic has been a difficult situation across borders, it has also brought to the forefront that challenging times can align agendas and priorities, generating political will from many actors to strengthen multi-stakeholder collaboration. It has also created more space for the local private sector to engage and be active in disaster response and recovery. And as it turns out, having less resources is not always an impediment when passionate, dedicated individuals champion collective and collaborative cross-sectoral action.  *If that describes you, what are you and your business doing to contribute to the resilience of the community (or communities) you are a part of?*  *Have you found that COVID-19 also aligned agendas and priorities? If so, how?*  The Connecting Business initiative (CBi) is a platform transforming the way the private sector engages before, during and after crises. It is supported by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).

3697868,"'Last year, my husband passed away. He was killed in the fighting,' shares Lakchia, a 30-year-old mother of six, as she holds her one-year old son, Allan, close to her chest.  On that day, Lakchia not only lost a loved one, she also lost her family's source of income and survival. Her cattle was stolen at the time of her husband's death. The flooding came next. Together, with her neighbours and six children, Lakchia moved to drier ground. 'I left my belongings and when I went back, I found them stolen,' she expresses. Now, she collects firewood to sell in order to provide for her family.  'Some days, we can eat, if I have been able to collect firewood. If there is no firewood, we don't eat. We are eating one meal a day. Hunger is our problem.'  In a nearby town, only reachable by boat, lives Nyandit and her family of four. She too lost cattle when armed men raided her town. 'Not long after the attack, the flood came,' Nyandit continues.  'When there was no flood, we used to dig to plant for harvest, but then the flood came. And our cattle have been taken. Now, there is hunger.'  A series of flooding and intercommunal fighting has greatly impacted Jonglei State and the Greater Pibor Administrative Area of South Sudan since 2019, resulting in destruction of property and livelihoods, hundreds of lives lost, and mass displacement. In early August 2020, the and the violence dwindled. Not long after, severe flooding started affecting the region yet again, affecting over 520,000 people*. Access to some areas was cut off while others require a boat or walking through knee-high water. People are living in congested conditions on small islands of dry land but when it rains, these islands too become flooded.  The people of Pibor County hardly have time to recover from one disaster before another hits.  When a measles outbreak threatened already vulnerable families in the region, with 300 suspected measles cases reported since mid-November**, Medair mobilised a mass vaccination campaign for over 18,000 children under five years of age. This highly infectious disease spreads to 90 per cent of non-immune people living with an infected person, creating serious health concerns for people living who live in congested conditions***. High rates of malnutrition make South Sudan's children more vulnerable to infection and the potential complications of measles are life-threatening.  As flooding subsides communities which are currently separated by water will begin to interact, so the vaccination campaign is critical in protecting vulnerable children and halting the spread of a potentially deadly disease.  Families like Lakchia's and Nyadit's are facing yet another crisis.  Their stories are not unique. They represent a small fragment of shared experiences: displacement, flooding, intercommunal violence, livelihoods lost, and food insecurity. One crisis starts as another fades, but the each one leaves lasting impact within the community.  As Medair, we cannot prevent all of the challenges faced by people in Pibor, but we can help stop the spread of a life-threatening disease. Vaccinating 18,000 children means they will no longer be at risk of contracting measles even into the future, and mothers like Lakchia and Nyadit will have one less reason to worry.  * * *  *Medair's South Sudan Emergency Response Team is supported by **EU Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO)**, UK aid from the UK government, and generous private donors. *  *This content was produced with resources gathered by Medair field and Global Support Office staff.

The delegations are scheduled to return to Kuwait on July 15 with practical recommendations regarding the implementation of the key principles required to sign a peace accord and end the conflict, according to the UN. On June 26, UN SecretaryGeneral (SYG) Ban Ki-moon addressed Yemeni delegates participating in the peace talks in Kuwait, underscoring the need for the peace negotiations to progress and the conflict to end.  - In violation of the continuing cessation of hostilities (CoH) agreement implemented in April, intensified clashes in some parts of Yemen, including Al Jawf, Marib, and Ta'izz governorates, have resulted in deaths and displacement in recent weeks. During his June 26 remarks to Yemeni delegations in Kuwait, SYG Ban acknowledged the relative reduction in hostilities since April, while also condemning serious violations of the CoH and calling for all fighting to halt immediately.  - Limited fuel and medicine imports, conflict-related medical facility destruction, medical staff displacement, and the ongoing economic crisis continue to negatively impact Yemen's health system, the UN reports. As of late May, Yemen had imported only 30 percent of the medicine and other medical supplies required countrywide, according to USAID/OFDA partner the UN World Health Organization (WHO).",['Insect Infestation'],"['Agriculture', 'Contributions', 'Food and Nutrition', 'Health', 'Logistics and Telecommunications', 'Mine Action', 'Peacekeeping and Peacebuilding', 'Protection and Human Rights', 'Shelter and Non-Food Items', 'Water Sanitation Hygiene']","['Somalia', 'United States of America', 'Yemen']",Situation Report
