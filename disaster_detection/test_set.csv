"Author Ahmad al Salim Location Idlib Humanitarian organisations are delivering urgent aid programmes to help needy Syrians affected by a particularly harsh winter. Aid convoys aimed at helping tens of thousands of people have been dispatched by the Sheikh Thani bin Abdullah Foundation for Humanitarian Services RAF , a Qatari charity, and the Turkish Humanitarian Relief Foundation. RAF’s latest million dollar Goodwill Ambassadors’ convoy consists of 48 trucks loaded with food, flour, winter clothing and dates. The consignment is intended to help 50,000 refugees plus others citizens living in northern Syria – Aleppo and the surrounding countryside, areas around Idlib and Hama, and the coast. More than 200 displaced families on the Turkish border will also receive aid and food packages. Local distribution is being carried out by the Sham Islamic Body. Its relief coordinator in Idlib, Hamza Hazeh, says conditions have been especially difficult this winter, particularly in the camps for internally displaced people. Hazeh said he hoped that other charity organisations might now follow suit and increase aid deliveries to Syrians living in abject conditions. “We began by preparing packages of winter clothes and shoes, some food and cleaning supplies, and distributing them immediately among the worst affected and neediest in the refugee camps,” he said. “We began by delivering in Marat al Numan and Jarjanaz in the south of Idlib province, and in Badama in the west. We will continue until we’ve distributed aid in all parts of the province.” Munhal al Khatib, who is supervising the allocation of aid in the villages and camps of Idlib province, told Damascus Bureau how the harsh winter had affected vulnerable citizens. “After the extreme cold and frost, we wanted to act as quickly as possible to alleviate the suffering of the displaced. We handed out winter blankets and bedspreads, as well as water purification tablets and cleaning supplies,” he said. “We saw an immense amount of suffering due to the severe cold. There were large numbers of women and children shivering from the cold as we distributed aid at one of the camps. “We are hoping that other relief organisations and charities will turn their attention to the displaced people in camps, in particular. The winter this year was long and unforgiving, and the suffering is only increasing.” The United Nations children’s agency UNICEF has partnered with the Sham Islamic Body to distribute cleaning supplies and drinking water to many areas in Idlib province, particularly to the camps where people are suffering from skin diseases due to contaminated water and burst sewer pipes. Yassin al Shartah, who came here from a government controlled area, said he was happy with the aid package he received. “There were some thick blankets inside,” he said, “as well as shoes and cold weather clothes for my small children, and some important food staples which we desperately needed, especially in winter when it’s impossible to find work.” Shartah expressed home that humanitarian aid groups would send heaters and fuel, as a number of children had died from the cold. “We are in dire need of fuel, and most Syrians are so hard hit by poverty and war that they can’t afford to buy any,” he said. Um Ahmad and her children live in a refugee camp on the fringes of Jarjanaz, having been displaced from their village in Abu Duhur in the east of Idlib province. She says the cold weather poses a grave threat to her family’s health, as their house is unfit for human habitation. The warm clothing handed out by volunteers has helped, but she is still worried about the lack of heating. “This winter was extremely cold,” Um Ahmad said. “I have six children and there are no clothes for them except for what I’ve been able to get from some charitable people. We’d like to thank them for their donations of cleaning supplies and food during these difficult times. And we hope they will make even greater efforts on our behalf.” Dozens of children were given shoes and winter jackets at a small event which coordinators of the relief campaign held as a way of making other organisations more aware of the need for additional aid. Reem, a seventh grade school pupil who received shoes, a winter coat, gloves and a hat, was happy with her new clothes. “It’s very cold in the mornings when we have to go to school,” she said. “My old coat was very worn, and now I can wear new nice clothes in front of my friends. With these gloves, I can even play outside when it’s snowing.” “The campaign won’t stop here,” Hazeh said. “We will continue to help those who are affected and in need, and displaced people in particular, because of what they are exposed to during the winter. There are Goodwill Ambassadors’ convoys slated to arrive very soon, carrying hundreds of ton of food aid. We hope these campaigns will help alleviate some of the catastrophic suffering that people are experiencing.”.",['Cold Wave']
" Agreement Will Require UN Oversight and Humanitarian Supervision On February 11, Venezuela's opposition and the government of Nicolás Maduro agreed to cooperate to purchase and distribute COVID 19 vaccines for 6 million people. Later this week, opposition health policy advisors and representatives of the government will meet to discuss details of distribution and oversight, creating a joint technical team alongside officials from the Pan American Health Organization PAHO and the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund UNICEF . As a research and advocacy organization that has advocated for a multilateral response to Venezuela's humanitarian emergency, the Washington Office on Latin America WOLA urges the United States, European Union and Latin American governments to recognize this achievement and embrace this initiative. At the same time, it should ensure that vaccination efforts are carried out in line with humanitarian principles. Strong multilateral oversight will be essential for this effort to succeed. This announcement represents a significant expansion of the accord reached under the auspices of PAHO in June 2020, in which the opposition committed to use 12 million in frozen funds to pay for health equipment and antigen tests in exchange for certain guarantees in distribution from the government. While protective equipment has largely been distributed https wola.us5.list manage.com track click?u 28bd3dd463a2079bdde8ce5f2 id 7198668a19 e 6c676f92a3 in compliance with the accord, so far PAHO officials say less than three percent of the antigen tests donated have been used. The rest are being kept in regional laboratories, which the opposition says is part of a government strategy to keep the reported number of positive cases low. Many other important details remain for the joint government opposition technical team, known as the Mesa Técnica Nacional, to finalize. One of them is the issue of vaccination priorities. Moving forward it is essential that any COVID vaccination campaign follow humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence. So far the government has demonstrated no respect for these principles , and Maduro has openly discussed plans to prioritize vaccinations for loyalists from his own political party. This would be unacceptable, and the international community must unequivocally refuse to contribute to anything other than an impartial distribution program. In addition to creating a plan for equitable distribution, the Mesa Técnica Nacional must also procure vaccines. About 1.4 million doses under this effort will reportedly come from the World Health Organization linked COVAX initiative, while the source of the rest of the vaccines needed is unclear. Separately, the Maduro government has managed to secure a limited amount 100,000 doses of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine, but has not been able to provide a timetable for when the rest would be given. Together, none of these initiatives are enough for the country to reach herd immunity. WOLA urges the international community to help mobilize resources in support of COVID vaccination in Venezuela, and to offer any technical and logistical assistance needed.

"Friday, September 3, 2021 Office of Press Relations press usaid.gov During the three weeks since a magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck Haiti, USAID and the Department of Defense U.S. Southern Command SOUTHCOM have been urgently working to deliver aid to hard to reach areas as quickly as possible. Today, because access to affected communities by land and sea has improved and civilian transportation options—including the UN’s air, truck, and barge services—have become available, we have jointly determined that U.S. military assets are no longer required for air transport and logistic support to the U.S. government humanitarian response. USAID requests for JTF Haiti to transport relief supplies and personnel to affected areas steadily declined in the last week, and all outstanding requests were completed as of September 2. USAID will continue to lead the U.S. response to the earthquake to deliver food, shelter, health and other urgent assistance to hard hit communities. At the request of USAID, SOUTHCOM stood up Joint Task Force JTF Haiti on August 15 to provide U.S. military logistics and air transport capabilities to reach hard to access affected areas. The U.S. Coast Guard also provided immediate support to U.S. response efforts by transporting relief personnel to affected areas while evacuating injured patients to Port au Prince for medical treatment. JTF Haiti—including the Coast Guard—mobilized 19 helicopters, six ships, and eight transport aircraft, as well as approximately 1,200 personnel, to support USAID’s response efforts. Over the course of 20 days in Haiti, JTF Haiti provided aerial imagery of damaged areas flew 671 missions to deliver aid and response personnel delivered almost 600,000 pounds of humanitarian cargo, including food, water, medical equipment, and other critical relief supplies transported approximately 200 aid workers, including USAID disaster experts, to affected area and assisted or rescued 477 people. I would like to thank SOUTHCOM Commander U.S. Navy Admiral Craig Faller, JTF Haiti Commander U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Keith Davids, and Coast Guard Seventh District Commander Rear Admiral Brendan McPherson for their steadfast leadership, and the entire SOUTHCOM and Coast Guard teams for their tireless efforts to rapidly push out and deliver aid to hard to reach areas in the critical early days of the response before sufficient civilian and commercial transportation options became available. USAID’s Disaster Assistance Response Team DART remains on the ground and continues to work tirelessly to get Haitians the assistance they need. This includes releasing additional food from USAID’s pre positioned stocks, supplying healthcare facilities with emergency medical kits, and deploying nearly 900,000 additional pounds of relief items—including, plastic sheets, shelter repair kits, blankets, buckets, water containers, hygiene kits, and kitchen sets—from USAID’s Miami warehouse to Port au Prince. USAID’s DART will continue working with the Government of Haiti and our partners to bring about a seamless transition of operations supported by JTF Haiti to those supported by Haitian authorities, UN agencies, non governmental organizations, and commercial transportation companies. The number of civilian organizations supporting earthquake response efforts in the affected areas has also increased. As of September 1, according to the UN, more than 95 NGOs and international organizations are delivering humanitarian assistance and supporting relief operations in Haiti, including 68 in Sud Department and Nippes and 28 in Grand Anse. These organizations are augmenting the critical work of the numerous local organizations who have been supporting their communities since the earthquake. USAID is also coordinating closely with the Government of Haiti and international donors to assess the country’s larger post earthquake needs. USAID is working to support the Haitian people in their efforts to build a Haiti that is more resilient to environmental, political, and economic shocks and stresses advances more inclusive, locally driven economic growth and promotes governance that is more responsive to citizens’ needs.",['Earthquake']
"Tuesday, May 18, 2021 Office of Press Relations press usaid.gov The United States, through the U.S. Agency for International Development USAID , is airlifting plastic sheeting for shelter needs, kitchen sets, and other relief supplies to save lives and meet the urgent needs of the Palau people in response to Typhoon Surigae. Arriving in Palau from USAID's warehouse in Miami, this airlift will support emergency response efforts for more than 3,000 people, with more on the way. This shipment of relief supplies totals approximately 56,000, and comes at a critical moment as some communities remain without access to electricity, safe drinking water, and sanitation services. Relief supplies will be provided to partner International Organization for Migration for immediate distribution. Along with this flight, USAID is announcing 100,000 in additional assistance to support storm affected families' rapid recovery. This new funding builds on USAID's initial support of 100,000 in life saving aid provided in the initial days after the storm. Today's assistance will be provided to the Palau Red Cross Society PRCS , through USAID partner the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies IFRC , to support on the ground relief efforts. Through USAID, total U.S. humanitarian assistance provided to the people of Palau, in response to Typhoon Surigae, is more than 256,000. This surge of humanitarian assistance supports USAID's broader response efforts to ensure emergency life saving aid reaches the people who need it most. Last week, the UN World Food Program, supported in part by USAID, deployed a flight of Government of Australia and IFRC emergency relief supplies to further support affected communities in Palau.

" I. Introduction 1 . The present report is submitted pursuant to Security Council resolution 2296 2016 , by which the Council extended the mandate of the African Union United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur UNAMID until 30 June 2017 and requested me to report, every 90 days, on its implementation. The report provides an update and analysis of the conflict and the political situation and operational environment in Darfur, including the main challenges to the effective implementation of the mandate, from 15 June to 15 September 2016. It also presents the steps taken by UNAMID towards achieving its benchmarks and describes progress made in the implementation of the recommendations of the Secretary General and the Chairperson of the African Union Commission, as presented in their joint report of 8 June 2016 S 2016 510 and endorsed in resolution 2296 2016 . Lastly, the report provides an update on the transfer of tasks to the United Nations country team and the development of an exit strategy for UNAMID. II. Conflict dynamics and security situation A. Current trends and conflict dynamics 2 . Following the intense fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Sudan Liberation Army Abdul Wahid SLA AW in the Jebel Marra between January and May, there have been only sporadic ground skirmishes, along with reports of aerial bombardments in the same area, since June. A seasonal spike in violence between pastoralists and farmers occurred in Darfur amid a fall in the number of large scale intercommunal clashes. Incidents of crime, including banditry, attacks on internally displaced persons and sexual and gender based violence, remained a significant driver of insecurity throughout Darfur. Fighting between government forces and rebel groups 3 . As a result of its recent air and ground military operations, the Government of the Sudan partially succeeded in limiting the area of operations of SLA AW by dislodging its combatants from several of its bases in the foothills of the Jebel Marra. However, SLA AW continued to maintain pockets of presence in areas close to Sortony, North Darfur, and prevented the takeover by the Sudanese Armed Forces of the main mountainous part of the Jebel Marra in Central Darfur, in particular the area east of Nertiti, south of Golo, and between Rockero and Golo. 4 . To secure unhindered freedom of movement near the bases captured from SLA AW in Kutum and Sarrong, the army launched several attacks on rebel positions from those areas. On 20 June, the army attempted to capture Kwila, 20 km northeast of Nertiti in Central Darfur. SLA AW retaliated with an attack against an army base in Boldon, Central Darfur, 18 km southeast of Nertiti. On 27 June, government forces attacked SLA AW locations in Tui and Korambe in North Darfur, 3 km east of Sortony. In apparent support for the army and to prevent SLA AW forces from securing logistical supplies, armed Arabs, mostly from the Northern Rezeigat tribe, and some suspected of being members of the Rapid Support Forces, continued to maintain a watchful presence to monitor the road between Kabkabiyah and Sortony in North Darfur. 5 . Notwithstanding the Government’s announcement on 30 June of a unilateral ceasefire, intermittent skirmishes between the army and SLA AW continued throughout July and August. On 7 August, the army conducted aerial bombardments targeting SLA AW positions in the areas of Konda and Boranga, 20 km east of Nertiti. SLA AW forces reportedly retaliated with an attack against an army position in Kutum, east of Nertiti, on 8 August. Army aircraft reportedly carried out further aerial bombardments in Boldon on 27 August. UNAMID was unable to verify those reports, including the number of casualties reported in the media, owing to the repeated refusal of the Government to grant access to the area, citing security reasons. 6 . There was no military engagement between the army and the Justice and Equality Movement JEM or the Sudan Liberation Army Minni Minnawi SLA MM .","['Drought', 'Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Other']"
"ACT Alliance has supported the communities that were affected by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami in September 2018 through its members in Indonesia. Two years later, we went back to the people we assisted to see how they have recovered. The 7.5 magnitude earthquake in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia, had disastrous consequences, as it also triggered a tsunami which hit the provincial capital of Palu. More than 4,300 people lost their lives, over 200,000 were displaced and nearly 70,000 houses destroyed. Many shops and other small businesses as well as the irrigation systems for family farms were destroyed, causing countless families to lose their incomes. ACT Alliance members Yakkum Emergency Unit YEU http www.yeu.or.id , Indonesian Christian Association for Health Service ICAHS PELKESI http www.pelkesi.or.id and Church World Service CWS https cwsglobal.org our work asia indonesia , with their partners coordinated, their responses through the ACT appeal, targeting 100,000 vulnerable people affected by the earthquake and tsunami. All three organisations supported the Sigi district in Central Sulawesi, which had one of the highest numbers of casualties caused by mudflows and liquefaction after the earthquake. Several aftershocks damaged more buildings and houses causing even more people to become homeless. More independence for people with disability One of the persons supported by ACT Alliance in the Sigi district is Sudirman picture above right , a man who has lived in Ngatabaru all his life and is paralyzed from the waist down. He can inspire you with stories about his adventures as a driver for tourists before his sickness made it impossible for him to drive again six years ago. After that, it was difficult for Sudirman to move around his house even going to the toilet was an ordeal on his own. He needed a caretaker all the time. Sudirman's house was damaged by the earthquake and he and his family had to live in the part of it which was relatively safe for them. YEU organized workers to help them build a new home specifically designed for people with disabilities. Sudirman and his wife assisted, supervising the work and selecting the materials used. With YEU's support, they could also learn new skills and earn some income while work was difficult to find. His new home allowed Sudirman better mobility which made him more independent. He and his family, in YEU trainings, learned more about how to manage his health issues. The house was completed in April 2019, and he has been living there ever since. I can now do things on my own without needing a caretaker with me all day, since I can move around the house without assistance. My family also knows how they can support me better while also enjoying their own lives , he says. Focus on infrastructure as well as on psychological aspects Disasters often leave people traumatized as they have to handle their losses and recover from the fear they experienced. YEU trained schools and communities on psychosocial care and support while at the same time ensuring safe space and a protected environment to develop, learn, play and build resilience. CWS provided water tanks and safe water during the early days after the disaster in Sigi while they as well as the government worked on repairing pipelines and improving water supply in the villages. The organisation also supported communities to set up Water Management Committees so that people could manage the water system themselves when the project ends. We now have enough clean water, without needing to worry about where to get it. Better still, we are managing the water system ourselves, so we know that when something goes wrong, we can fix it , says Badrun, Committee member in Sikara Tobata village, Donggala district. Ensuring health services Maslia, a village health cadre from Enu, Donggala, received health training and support from PELKESI which she was grateful for since their health clinic was closed for several months after the disaster. PELKESI's mobile clinics with volunteer doctors and nurses provided the health services during this period, while the government health clinics were unable to do so as the staffs were affected by the disaster themselves. Health workers and villagers in the areas where PELKESI was active after the disaster learned about traditional health techniques, acupressure, and herbal medicine using local resources. Mothers were also taught how to cook food using local foodstuffs and herbal drinks from plants that they used to think of as weeds or useless, that can be found in their backyard. PELKESI assisted the health cadres to get an official policy and budget to provide supplementary food for the infants and toddlers in ten villages Simoro, Tuva, Sibalaya Utara, Sibalaya Barat, Pantoloan, Baiya, Enu, Lero Tatari, Desa Wani Satu, Desa Wani Dua through a village grant. Before the earthquake and tsunami, there were only two villages which provided supplementary food cost for children. Now, through several discussions between health cadres and host governments, all ten villages have policies to provide budget for supplementary food for children. This achievement is particularly meaningful during the COVID 19 pandemic. New sources of income New ways to earn a living had to be found after the disasters. Yohanes Rombe https actalliance.org ?post type act news p 11113 a year ago was able to plant corn, peppers, and other vegetables thanks to irrigation being available for the crops from a new well built by CWS. He has now been able to harvest a crop to feed himself and his family Besides facilitating farming by building or re establishing irrigation systems, CWS and its partners also collected new ideas from community members to restore or create opportunities to earn a living. These initiatives were initiated months before the outbreak of COVID 19, but later on also helped people to get through the lockdown. Introducing relevant safety measures, people could still run their local kiosks, do fish farming and drying, brown sugar milling, produce snacks and coconut oil for home use. We learnt how important it is for all of us to think of alternative ways to process and sell our local products. Why shouldn't we do something new with it? , states Mirnawati from Lende Tovea village, Donggala district. How did COVID 19 change the situation? Due to the pandemic at the beginning of 2020, humanitarian response activities that were nearly done had to be slowed down or adapted. Prevention education needed to be prioritized, printing and distributing educational materials for families and leading public education and correct information sharing about the virus. ACT members adhere to health protocol as required in all of our interventions through several actions did local radio broadcasting in Palu, introduced safety measures to staff and visitors in hospitals, were active on social media, and distributed face masks for the vulnerable groups elderly, persons with disabilities and children . Although having to deal with COVID 19 represented an additional challenge to the disaster response, the ACT Alliance members are optimistic that they will reach the objectives of the appeal in the coming months. What is needed for the future are educating communities on the importance of growing vegetables and fruits for food security, health trainings and hygiene promotions to prevent the local transmission of the virus, ensuring permanent safe water gravity fed piped water systems and boreholes , livelihood supports for small and medium enterprises including home based business and community based disaster preparedness initiatives.

Fire fighting equipment and training b p 18. Provision of standard packages of ground fire fighting equipment as an immediate emergency support to the ongoing fire fighting efforts in the affected provinces is considered as the highest priority. According to BAKORNAS PB UNDAC estimates, 43 basic response packages and 12 peat fire response packages are recommended as a minimum requirement for the provinces of Riau, Jambi, South Sumatra, Lampung, Kalimantan and Irian Jaya. A basic response package consists of equipment for fire fighting, personal protection, light pumping and water carrying. A peat fire response package consists of four medium size portable fire pumps, hose and ancillary equipment which will augment the basic package.

It is envisaged that some medical supplies would also be distributed through the Indonesian Red Cross. p b c. Drinking water b p 25. The continued drought has raised concerns about the safety of drinking water in Irian Jaya, Kalimantan, Jambi and South Sumatra. With the exception of Irian Jaya, there have been no formal requests so far for emergency assistance, either through WHO or UNICEF, but this might change. Prefabricated emergency type water treatment units are reportedly available on the local market and their distribution to the affected areas could be arranged.

"FREEPORT, Grand Bahama Minister of State for Disaster Preparedness, Management and Reconstruction, the Hon. Pakesia Parker Edgecombe says the formation of the Ministry of Disaster Preparedness, Management and Reconstruction signifies just how serious the Minnis Administration is about putting in place a ministry that is specifically designed to address disaster risk management and mitigation. She noted that The Bahamas is the only one in the region, thus far, to do so. “As my Ministry moves forward in strengthening policy and legislation surrounding disaster preparedness, management and reconstruction, we do so recognizing that we too have a role to play,” Minister Parker Edgecombe noted. “There must be stronger working systems and shelters an increase in capacity, better communication. There must be put in place legislation that protects each and every one of you. As many of you would have also lost during the storm, while helping the government of the day and helping others. It is only right.” The State Minister’s remarks came during a service of appreciation for the volunteers of Hurricane Dorian, for their acts of kindness shown before, during and following the devastating hurricane. The service was held on Thursday, June 24, 2021, at Calvary Temple Assemblies of God. Minister Parker Edgecombe pointed out that the government is focused on putting in place safety measures for all Bahamians. “The mandatory evacuation orders have since come into effect,” she noted. “Our country remains an active member of the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency CDEMA . We are insured as a nation in the event of a disaster. The National Emergency Management Agency NEMA continues to solidify its mandate of preparing and managing disasters and the newly formed Disaster Reconstruction Authority is progressing in its recovery and reconstruction efforts. “We are a coastal nation and amidst climate change, we recognized the need for focused attention in this sector. It is a proactive approach, rather than that of reaction. Hurricanes have been the main disasters experienced in our country, and while that is the case, we must position ourselves to fight any disaster that comes our way.” Parker Edgecombe encouraged those volunteers present to continue to take part in the training that is available. She admonished them to speak to family and friends about coming into the fold of service, because all Bahamians need each other to survive. “Every sector present here today is important,” she added. “We cannot work in silos. We must join hands tightly. The common goal being saving lives amidst any disaster. I am truly honored to be here with you, recognizing that each and every one of you present here today, epitomizes the true essence of being your brother’s keeper and for that we are grateful. Because of you, many lives have been saved over the years, most recently during Hurricane Dorian.” The Minister of State noted that Hurricane Dorian, was undoubtedly the worst storm that the Commonwealth has ever experienced. She said major devastation was incurred and not only did people lose properties and homes, but many people lost loved ones. Minister Parker Edgecombe admitted that while preparation took place at best, no one expected the ferocity that came along with a category five hurricane. “We are not all the same,” she said. “Our lives will not be the same. 2019 and 2020 in particular, have changed us forever. Not only have we had to rebuild following Hurricane Dorian, but we have had to face the COVID 19 pandemic amidst it. We are being tested and we are being tried. Our homes and communities, left vulnerable. “I am a believer, however, that all that has been done, especially the sacrifices made on your part, is the foundation that will ensure that as we rebuild, we do so even stronger. Today you are all being recognized. You did not have to do what you did. You could have chosen to stay indoors and carry on with your lives. You could have chosen to sit back and watch. You could have chosen to have someone else step forward, but you came forward. “Your love for your brothers and sisters and, clearly, your love for your country has been demonstrated by your actions. “Today, it brings me pleasure to say to each and every one of you ‘thank you for all that you have done and what you will continue to do’. Your communities need you and your country is blessed to have you.”.",['Tropical Cyclone']
" AMBRYM VOLCANO 16°15’00”S 168°07’00”E Summit Elevation 4377ft 1334m Current Vanuatu Volcano Alert Level Level 1 Ambrym volcano is now in the minor unrest state. The Volcanic Alert Level is lowered from Level 2 to Level 1. The current volcanic activity at Ambrym is consistent with Volcanic Alert Level 1. New scientific analysis suggest three 3 possible scenarios as the future volcanic activity for Ambrym in the short term. These are 1 Most likely activity continues at current unrest level. This scenario 1 means that the Ambrym volcano activity consist mainly of obvious steam from the eruptive vents inside the summit craters Benbow and Marum including Maben Mbwelesu, Niri Mbwelesu and Mbwelesu like it was in 2001 2017. We consider this scenario 1 is likely as the volcano has just had a fissure eruption in December 2018 that induced the drainage of the lava lakes at the summit caldera and the Eastern Rift Zone down to the coast. Volcanic hazards remain about the summit craters area and the South East part of Ambrym Island e.g. major cracks from 2018 . 2 Not very likely activity to decline to a lower level. This scenario 2 means that the Ambrym volcano activity will become even less than now. We consider this scenario 2 is less likely as Ambrym is a very active volcano and will in the short term always have some form of volcanic unrest or activity. Activity would remain at the summit craters with minor volcanic hazards risk . 3 Not very likely unrest activity to increase and eruptive activity to restart. This scenario 3 means that the Ambrym volcano could undergo another eruptive phase at the summit area. We consider this scenario 3 is unlikely as the volcano has just finished a moderate eruption episode and has not recovered. This activity, if it does occur, would consist of explosive activity with volcanic ashes and gases emission from the eruptive vents inside the summit craters Benbow and Marum . The activity may impact communities on Ambrym. Hazards and activity could be like it was from 2018. Although volcanic activity has declined to unrest level, some volcanic hazards do remain on Ambrym specifically at the summit and eastern part of the Island. These are related to the presence of cracked areas. In addition to the summit hazards, the presence of active rifts and faults major ground cracking at the South East area of Ambrym are also hazardous, they will continue to be eroded and affected by earthquake activity. The danger zones at the summit caldera remains at 1 km around Benbow and 2 km around Marum craters including Maben Mbwelesu, Niri Mbwelesu and Mbwelesu See Safety Map Fig.1 . The danger zone for life safety remains limited at the Permanent Exclusion Zone at Benbow and Danger Zone A at Marum . An additional danger zone at the South East of Ambrym is now within 500 meters from major cracks . Open cracks in the South East Ambrym that formed during the December 2018 eruption may continue to open due to erosion. Major earthquake activity could continue to affect these cracks and weak layers or areas around the actives craters. Latest field observations confirm that the Ambrym volcano activity has declined and conditions become stable. There is no significant manifestation of its volcanic activity and we now recognize the activity as minor unrest. The lava lakes that used to appear in Benbow and Marum craters have disappeared since the December 2018 eruption. The remaining activity inside both craters consist mainly of steam emissions. People from Ambrym and neighbouring islands will not see the volcanic glow at nights and the gas plume. The Volcanic Alert Level for Ambrym has been at the Level 2 since 14th February 2019. Observations of the current activity are consistent with Volcanic Alert Level 1 activity. Level 1 indicates “Minor unrest. Danger zone remains at 1 km around Benbow, 2 km around Marum and 500 meters from major cracked areas in the South East part of Ambrym” . Nevertheless, it is a useful reminder that eruptions can occur with little or no warnings. Ambrym volcano is a very active volcano in Vanuatu with large caldera of 12 km in diameter and 2 active craters, Marum and Benbow. The volcano has been active during historical time at both summit and flank vents, producing moderate explosive eruptions and lava flows that have reached the coast. The larger events include eruptions in 1820, 1894, 1913 or 1929. Over the last seventy years before the 2018 eruption , there have been no eruptions that extended beyond the summit caldera. The eruption of 1988 and 2015 are focused in the caldera. The December 2018 eruption was focused in the summit caldera, and also affected the Eastern Fracture or Rift Zone with ground deformation, rifting, faulting and uplift, but no eruption occurred there. All tourism agencies, local authorities, people of Ambrym and the general public are advice that due to the presence of cracked areas at the caldera, the danger zone remains at the Permanent Exclusion Zone at Benbow and the Danger Zone A at Marum which are set about 1 km radius from Benbow and 2 km radius from Marum. There are life safety hazards within these hazard zones. Due to the presence of active rifts and faults at the South East area of Ambrym, communities concerned are advised not to access within 500 meters from major cracks Danger Zone . There is a possibility low that earthquake or volcanic activity may start from this area. More information about the hazards can be found here on the Ambrym Volcano Advice Key Messages https www.vmgd.gov.vu vmgd index.php geohazards volcano volcano info resources. The Vanuatu Meteorology and Geohazards Department continues to closely monitor this volcano activity. More information will be provided as soon as necessary.

" HIGHLIGHTS Women and children in Pakistan require urgent support, due to surge in the COVID 19 cases with the third wave, an ongoing nutrition emergency and recurrent disasters. As of 23rd June, there are 950,768 confirmed cases of COVID 19 and the global acute malnutrition rate is 18 percent. In its response to COVID 19, UNICEF is prioritizing prevention and supporting health and nutrition service continuity by empowering health workers with training and equipment. UNICEF is providing timely accurate information promoting behaviors that reduce risk and limit transmission facilitating infection prevention and control supporting learning continuity providing psychosocial support and working to prevent stigma. UNICEF is also responding to the protracted nutrition emergency with curative and preventive life saving services, including community management of acute malnutrition maternal, infant and young child health and infant and young child feeding services. UNICEF requires US 61.4 million to provide life saving response in Pakistan, mitigate the impacts of COVID 19 and ensure emergency preparedness. HUMANITARIAN SITUATION AND NEEDS The first imported case of COVID 19 was reported in Pakistan on 25 February 2020. As of 23rd June 2021, there are more than 950,768 confirmed COVID 19 cases, including over 895,690 patients who have recovered and been discharged and 22,073 deaths. Pakistan is going through a third wave of COVID 19 cases due to which this appeal is being revised to accommodate higher targets as per current support needs. There are 20 high burden cities with the highest number of COVID 19 positive cases. Due to lack of continuity of essential health services, the risk of additional morbidities and mortalities is significant, and women and children urgently need access to information and care. Water, sanitation and hygiene WASH infrastructure is urgently needed, as washing hands with soap – a key COVID 19 prevention measure – has increased the burden on water services. Without safe and effective WASH facilities services in schools, health care facilities and communities, an estimated 850,000 children will be at risk of malnutrition and preventable diseases, including diarrhea, typhoid, cholera and polio. The closure of nearly 197,000 educational facilities has severely disrupted the already weak education system and jeopardized the learning of millions of children in Pakistan. Before the pandemic, 22.8 million children including 12.1 million girls were out of school in Pakistan. Pakistan is also seeing a rise in child protection risks in the context of the COVID 19 pandemic, including physical and emotional mistreatment, gender based violence, psychosocial distress and mental health challenges. Pakistan Country brief on learning continuity amidst COVID 19 school closures disseminated on 17th June 2021, found that lack of access to technology, motivation, domestic chores and working outside the home are some of the barriers to learning during the closures of schools. Pakistan is facing a protracted nutrition emergency. The national global acute malnutrition rate is nearly 18 per cent, exceeding the internationally agreed emergency threshold of 15 per cent. If urgent action is not taken, this will lead to rising mortality rates among children under 5 years. A recent study estimates that child wasting could lead to an 18 per cent increase in young child mortality. Pakistan also suffers from recurrent natural shocks earthquakes, floods, drought and epidemics and strengthened preparedness and risk reduction measures is critical to curtail losses and support effective responses to future emergencies.","['Earthquake', 'Epidemic', 'Flood', 'Tropical Cyclone']"
" Beirut is the centre of a massive clean up operation as people come together to set up emergency support services following last week's explosions. Yet shelter remains scarce. Food supplies are heavily disrupted and the threat of a prolonged humanitarian crisis is increasing. Find out how our staff in Lebanon are working to meet urgent needs... The devastating impact of the Beirut explosions continue to be felt. More than 300,000 people have been made homeless. At the time of writing 171 people have been reported killed and 5,000 wounded 1,000 of whom are children while hundreds more are still missing. Damage to the city's docks destroyed an estimated 120,000 metric tonnes of food stocks. And according to UNICEF, 100,000 children have had their homes damaged and are displaced, while 120 schools serving 55,000 children are in various states of disrepair. The city's residents are in shock and dealing with trauma yet their spirits are not broken. Lebanese people have opened their doors to host survivors. They have also set up community kitchens and other basic emergency support services. What I remember most from those few hours following the explosion was the kindness of Lebanese people, says War Child researcher Felicity Brown. The pharmacist who first cleaned my cuts was patient and resourceful even though he was exhausted by that time and some things were out of stock. Rapid response War Child staff in Lebanon have been on the ground in Beirut since the day after the explosions helping in any way possible. They are cleaning up debris and offering food and water. They are also providing clothing and psychosocial support to those people most affected by the blast. Yet there is much more to do. In the coming weeks it is expected that food items will become increasingly expensive and scarce. Many people are expected to remain homeless for months to come. The COVID 19 pandemic remains a serious threat. And in the absence of proper shelter and health services, the onset of winter is expected to take a heavy toll on infants and young children. Providing sustained support War Child will in the months to come step up efforts to provide psychosocial care and support to children and families experiencing shock and continuing trauma. These efforts will be built on the foundations of our ongoing programme including our work amongst refugees and our most recent work to shield children and families from the effects of the COVID 19 pandemic. We will also work with our partners on the ground to meet immediate humanitarian needs. We will take part in efforts to build temporary homes and find shelter for displaced people. We will also support efforts to deliver food to the most vulnerable people. War Child humanitarian director Dr. Unni Krishnan warns that the road to recovery will be a long one. People in Lebanon are facing multiple crises, unfolding simultaneously, he says. Relief and recovery are not going to be a short sprint but a long marathon. In this complex humanitarian setting, when there are a hundred things to be done, meeting the needs of children is a great place to start. .","['Epidemic', 'Technological Disaster']"

Poverty is highest among children reaching 56 per cent. And amid COVID19, the situation has worsened pushing more families into deep poverty. With 3.7 million children out of school in Afghanistan, more than 60 per cent of them are girls. UNICEF with funding from the US Department of State Secretary's Office of Global Women's Issues US SOGWI , is supporting adolescent girls’ education through the Afghan Women’s Leadership Initiative. ‘This initiative aims to support and empower adolescent girls,’ says Aye Aye Than, Adolescent Specialist, UNICEF Afghanistan. ‘Through support to girls’ education, we can prevent child marriage.’ This programme includes community engagement and mobilization to prevent child marriage and encourage girls’ education. It also supports the establishment of safe spaces, and the provision of life skills and livelihood training. Yet, for many girls like Hasiba, the main barrier to going to school is lack of money. Cash transfers make girls’ education possible As part of this initiative, UNICEF launched a cash transfer programme to support adolescent girls’ education. The programme helps to reduce the impact of the conflict and COVID19 pandemic on vulnerable families, and improve their access basic services, especially girls’ education. In Herat, 472 families in need, who have adolescent girls aged between 10 and 15 years benefitted from this cash transfer. ‘Families are receiving a one off unconditional and unrestricted cash transfer of 19,500 AFN 255 ,’ says Than. ‘UNICEF has no restrictions on spending of the cash transfers, leaving the decision on how to spend the cash transfer with the family. However, families are encouraged to use the money to support their adolescent girls’ education.’ Prior to cash distribution, the implementing partner in Herat, Women Activities Social Services Association WASSA , carried out awareness raising and consultation sessions with the communities, including local government representatives. During these sessions, the criteria of the cash transfers were clearly explained to ensure community acceptance and understanding. ‘When I received a call about the cash distribution, I shed tears of happiness,’ says Abdul Haq. ‘Now I can buy my children books, pens and notebooks.’ Various studies have shown that cash transfers to vulnerable families can have a positive impact on school enrollment and retention, especially for girls. To ensure accountability to affected population, UNICEF developed a complaints and feedback mechanism. This enables beneficiaries and community members to report any issues related to the programme. “I understand the power of education,’ says Abdul Haq. ‘I don’t want my daughter to marry until she completes her education to become an independent woman.’.",['Epidemic']
" I. Introduction 1 . The present report is submitted pursuant to Security Council resolution 2567 2021 https undocs.org en S RES 2567 2021 , by which the Council extended the mandate of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan UNMISS to 15 March 2022 and requested the Secretary General to report on the implementation of the Mission’s mandate every 90 days. The report covers political and security developments, the humanitarian and human rights situation and progress towards the implementation of the Mission’s mandate from 1 February to 31 May 2021. II. Political and economic developments 2 . On 22 February, South Sudan marked the one year anniversary of the formation of the Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity. On this occasion, international partners and local stakeholders commended the progress but noted the lack of movement in some critical areas. They called upon the parties to accelerate efforts to reconstitute the Transitional National Legislative Assembly, finalize state and local government structures, implement transitional security arrangements, establish transitional justice mechanisms and comprehensively implement the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan. 3 . Between 20 February and 2 March, the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, issued presidential decrees appointing ministers, advisers, commissioners and chairpersons of independent commissions at the state level and delegated powers to the state governors to swear them in. These appointments fell short of the stipulation in the Revitalized Agreement that women should make up 35 per cent of the appointees. 4 . On 23 March, the then Minister for Presidential Affairs, Nhial Deng Nhial, announced that elections envisioned to take place in 2022 could not be conducted without a permanent constitution and a population census. He said that more time for preparation was required and that elections would be held in 2023. On 14 April, the Press Secretary of the President, Ateny Wek Ateny, reiterated that the Government planned to hold general elections in 2023. 5 . In Juba on 8 April, in partnership with the United Nations Population Fund UNFPA , other United Nations entities and the Governments of Sweden, Ireland and Kenya, the Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity launched a population estimation survey. Survey results will guide the planning for the conduct of a full population and housing census in 2022. The last population and housing census was conducted in 2008. 6 . On 10 April, the President issued a series of decrees relieving and appointing senior officials. The Minister for Presidential Affairs, Nhial Deng Nhial, was replaced by Barnaba Marial Benjamin. The Chief of Defence Forces, General Johnson Juma Okot, was replaced by the South Sudan People’s Defence Forces Assistant Chief of Defence Forces for Administration and Finance, General Santino Deng Wol, who is on the sanctions list pursuant to Security Council resolution 2206 2015 https undocs.org en S RES 2206 2015 . The President also promoted the Director of the National Security Service, General Akol Koor Kuc, to the rank of First Lieutenant General. 7 . Between 8 and 11 May, the President dissolved the Transitional National Legislative Assembly and the Council of States and reconstituted the 400 member Transitional National Legislative Assembly as a 550 member parliament. However, the gender balance of appointments fell below the 35 per cent quota for women. 8 . On 26 March, the Ministry of Justice and Constitutional Affairs established a task force to oversee the implementation of chapter V of the Revitalized Agreement. However, the draft statute and the memorandum of understanding, critical to the operationalization of the Hybrid Court for South Sudan, are still pending signature by the Government and the African Union. 9 . From 25 to 27 May, the reconstituted Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission and the Max Planck Foundation for International Peace and the Rule of Law facilitated a three day workshop on the first permanent constitution making process. The workshop concluded with a resolution on the establishment, roles and mandates of institutions involved in the constitutional process civic education and public participation and the convening of a national constitutional conference. Implementation of the Revitalized Agreement 10 . On 15 March, the President requested the National Transitional Committee to report on the status of unifying the command, rank and file of the Necessary Unified Forces. On 18 March, the Chair of the National Transitional Committee, Tut Gatluak, tasked the Joint Defence Board to prepare a proposal for the unification of the Necessary Unified Forces command. 11 . On 22 March, the European Union imposed sanctions on South Sudan People’s Defence Forces Major General Moses Lokujo for the abduction and execution of three Sudan People’s Liberation Movement Army in Opposition SPLM A IO officers and attacking SPLM A IO forces at the Moroto training site in Central Equatoria. Peace process developments 12 . From 8 to 12 March, the peace talks brokered by the Community of Sant’Egidio between the South Sudan Opposition Movements Alliance SSOMA and the Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity took place in Naivasha, Kenya. The SSOMA faction of the Real Sudan People’s Liberation Movement, General Paul Malong of the South Sudan United Front Army SSUF A and the Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity signed the Declaration of Principles on 10 March. The Declaration of Principles will be the guiding framework for future talks between the parties. 13 . On 2 May, the SPLM A IO Chief of General Staff, General Simon Gatwech Dual, confirmed that Johnson Olony, leader of the Agwelek division of the SPLM A IO, promoted himself to the rank of First Lieutenant General. He dismissed allegations that Johnson Olony intended to defect to the Government or form a new rebel group. The Chief of General Staff expressed frustration with the delayed implementation of the transitional security arrangements and admitted to internal administrative challenges within the SPLM A IO. 14 . On 3 May, former South Sudan People’s Defence Forces Major General Stephen Buay Rolnyang joined General Malong’s SSUF A. One of the longest serving officers in the Defence Forces, Stephen Buay was accused of treason, dismissed and stripped of his rank. General Buay cited poor treatment of the Defence Forces’ rank and file, corruption and tribalism as reasons for his defection. Regional engagements and developments 15 . On 27 February, the President attended the twenty first Ordinary Summit of Heads of States of the East African Community, held virtually, where he recommended a regional visa waiver programme, appealed for capacity support especially with regard to facilitating the admission of the National Revenue Authority of South Sudan to the Customs Union of the East African Community and requested a formula that would enable South Sudan to pay its existing debt in instalments. 16 . In Juba, on 28 March, President Kiir witnessed the signing of the Declaration of Principles between the Transitional Government of the Sudan and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement North. President Kiir promised to continue efforts to include the Sudan Liberation Movement Abdul Wahid al Nur in the Sudan peace talks. Another round of talks resumed in Juba on 26 May. Other major national developments 17 . On 19 February, a section of the Jieng Council of Elders issued a statement stating that the Revitalized Agreement had failed to address the causes of insecurity in the country owing to a failure in leadership. The Council called for the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the National Dialogue Conference, including expedited elections. 18 . On 10 May, the National Dialogue Steering Committee presented to the President the final resolutions and the communiqué of the National Dialogue Conference. The President pledged to carefully consider the recommendations and implement the resolutions. Thereafter, he issued a decree dissolving the Committee. Economic situation 19 . The Government has stepped up economic reforms to address public financial management, improve transparency and enhance the mobilization of non oil revenue. In March, the International Monetary Fund approved a second Rapid Credit Facility loan of 174.2 million to alleviate the stress of the balance of payments associated with the coronavirus disease COVID 19 pandemic. In late March, the Bank of South Sudan committed to unifying the official and parallel exchange rates to alleviate the depreciation of the South Sudanese pound and reduce inflation. 20 . Food insecurity contributed to household hardships, with humanitarian organization struggling to fill the gap. In April 2021, the World Food Programme announced cuts in food rations to nearly 700,000 refugees and internally displaced people, who will receive 50 per cent of a full ration, down from 70 per cent. 21 . On 22 March, the Auditor General released a report on the accounts held at the Bank of South Sudan relating to the 2 and 3 per cent of net oil revenue designated for petroleum producing states and communities, respectively. From July 2011 to 31 December 2020, 85,735,541 was deposited in both accounts. From 2014 to 2020, 84,062,073 was disbursed, of which payments of 55,925,556 were made to parties other than those stipulated under the Petroleum Revenue Management Act 2013 . The audit did not examine how the money transferred to the states was used.","['Drought', 'Epidemic', 'Flood', 'Other']"
" Section 1 INTRODUCTION Apart from a short break during 1940 1946, surface observations of meteorological elements since 1884 have been summarized and published in the Observatory's Meteorological Results. Upper air observations began in 1947 and from then onwards the annual publication was divided into two parts, namely Part I Surface Observations and Part II Upper air Observations. These two publications were re titled Summary of Radiosonde Radiowind Ascents and Surface Observations in Hong Kong in 1981 and 1987 respectively. In 1993, both of these publications were made obsolete, and since then surface and upper air data have been included in one revised publication entitled Summary of Meteorological Observations in Hong Kong . During the period 1884 1939, reports on some destructive typhoons were printed as Appendices to the Meteorological Results. This practice was extended and accounts of all tropical cyclones which caused gales in Hong Kong were included in the Director's Annual Departmental Reports from 1947 to 1967 inclusive. The series Meteorological Results Part III Tropical Cyclone Summaries was subsequently introduced. It contained information on tropical cyclones over the western North Pacific and the South China Sea. The first issue, which contained reports on tropical cyclones occurring in 1968, was published in 1971. Tropical cyclones within the area bounded by the Equator, 45oN, 100o E and 160o E were described. With reconnaissance aircraft reports terminated from August 1987 onwards and satellite pictures facilitating the tracking of tropical cyclones over the otherwise datasparse ocean, the eastern boundary of the area of coverage was extended from 160o E to 180o from 1985 onwards. Starting from 1987, the series was re titled as Tropical Cyclones in 19YY but its contents remained largely the same. Tracks of tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific and the South China Sea were published in Meteorological Results up to 1939 and in Meteorological Results Part I from 1947 to 1967. Before 1961, only daily positions were plotted on the tracks. The time of the daily positions varied to some extent in the older publications but remained fixed at 0000 UTC after 1944. Details of the variation are given in the Royal Observatory Technical Memoir No. 11, Volume 1. From 1961 onwards, six hourly positions are shown on the tracks of all tropical cyclones. Provisional reports on individual tropical cyclones affecting Hong Kong have been prepared since 1960 to meet the immediate needs of the press, shipping companies and others. These reports are printed and supplied on request. Initially, reports were only written on those tropical cyclones for which gale or storm signals had been hoisted in Hong Kong. By 1968, it had become necessary to produce a report on every tropical cyclone that necessitated the hoisting of tropical cyclone warning signals. In this publication, tropical cyclones are classified into the following four categories according to the maximum sustained surface winds near their centres A TROPICAL DEPRESSION T.D. has maximum sustained winds of less than 63 km h. A TROPICAL STORM T.S. has maximum sustained winds in the range 63 87 km h. A SEVERE TROPICAL STORM S.T.S. has maximum sustained winds in the range 88 117 km h. A TYPHOON T. has maximum sustained winds of 118 km h or more. Throughout this publication, maximum sustained surface winds when used without qualification refer to wind speeds averaged over a period of 10 minutes. Mean hourly winds are winds averaged over a 60 minute interval ending on the hour. Daily rainfall amounts are computed over a 24 hour period ending at midnight Hong Kong Time. Over the western North Pacific and the South China Sea, tropical cyclone names are assigned by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Guam according to a pre determined list that undergoes revisions from time to time. Since 1981, a common system for identification of tropical cyclones in the western North Pacific and the South China Sea has been adopted and the Japan Meteorological Agency is delegated with the responsibility of assigning to each tropical cyclone of tropical storm intensity or above a numerical code of four digits. For example, the second tropical cyclone of tropical storm intensity or above as classified by Japan Meteorological Agency which occurred within the region in 1996 was assigned the code 9602 . In this publication, the appropriate code immediately follows the name of the tropical cyclone in bracket, e.g. Tropical Storm Ann 9602 . Surface wind data presented in this report were obtained from a network of anemometers operated by the Observatory. Details of the stations are listed on the next page .","['Extratropical Cyclone', 'Tropical Cyclone']"

" Save the Children ramps up emergency response https www.savethechildren.net what we do emergencies beirut crisis to support affected families and children. A week after the devastating explosion that ripped through Beirut, there are still children who are separated from their parents. Some children have been so badly affected that they have been unable to speak, while others cannot sleep. Save the Children’s teams on the ground have heard of children who are afraid to go into the room they were in when the explosion happened. Families are also increasingly concerned about a lack of healthy food for their children and some are living in badly damaged buildings. These are some of the findings of an assessment conducted by Save the Children, as the charity scales up its emergency response to help families who were caught up in the blast. The agency warned today that it is vital for children who have been left alone to be urgently reunited with parents. Being away from them at such a traumatic time, even if the children are temporarily living with extended family, can have a deeply harmful impact. “Children have experienced a terrible shock and need time to recover ,” said Rima Mohsen, alternative care specialist for Save the Children in Beirut. “They have been scared by what they have experienced and they will need someone close. Being separated from their parents can impact their mental health and recovery.” Dalal , 4, was without her parents for a week. Her mother was in hospital when the blast happened her father was at work and suffered a temporary loss of memory. Dalal stayed with her grandparents, where Save the Children helped the family to look after the girl. She was finally reunited with her mother Hala , 31, yesterday. Hala said “When the explosion happened, I was already in the emergency room at the hospital for surgery ’. I flew into the air and the window broke. I got a call from my father saying my daughter was crying and screaming and asking for me. My husband had temporary memory loss. He had to go to the hospital and I stayed with him. I was apart from my daughter for about a week. She would call a lot and ask me, ‘When are you coming back? Are we ever going back?’ “She had never been apart from me before. She was struggling to sleep, asking after me and her father. When we were finally together, she spent thirty minutes just crying. If I stand up now to go anywhere, she asks me where I am going and doesn’t want me to leave her at all.” Working with partners, Save the Children is supporting children who are separated from their parents. It identifies temporary alternative care for the children, ideally with relatives, and helps trace parents so that families can be reunited. “The explosion has torn families apart, and it’s vital that children are back with their parents as soon as possible” , Ms. Mohsen continued. “That is where they feel safe, secure. It gives them a sense of home, even if they have no home to go back to.” To help children cope with their experiences, Save the Children and its partners are providing psychological first aid, including guidance to parents on how to talk to their children about what happened. The assessment also found that many families are staying in apartments that are badly damaged because they have nowhere else to go. They are without electricity or any means to cook, forcing them to eat cold canned goods only, if they can afford food at all. “There also is a dire need of nutritious food” , said Jad Sakr, Save the Children’s country director in Lebanon. “Many families we came across were already struggling to survive even before the explosion hit but now the situation is even worse. Many small businesses have been affected, meaning livelihoods are lost. A lot of families lack money to buy food or building materials to restore their homes.” Save the Children is providing basic food assistance and shelter by helping with the clearance of debris and repair work. It is also supporting remote learning and the repairing of schools, so children don’t fall behind on their learning. To help affected families with their livelihoods, it is giving small grants to businesses to help them recover.

Separated children identified include those who have one or two parents in hospital or missing. They also include those who had to be relocated to stay with a family member away from home and without their immediate family. Save the Children’s response will also include providing shelter support for damaged buildings, ensure children have access to safety, protection and mental health support, and support for families to meet basic food needs in the aftermath of the explosion.

" AMBRYM VOLCANO 16°15’00”S 168°07’00”E Summit Elevation 4377ft 1334m Current Vanuatu Volcano Alert Level Level 1 Ambrym volcano is continuing in the minor unrest state. The Volcanic Alert Level remains at Level 1. The volcano activity at Ambrym is continuing at the low unrest level, consistent with the Volcanic Alert Level 1. New scientific analysis suggest that the Ambrym volcano activity is likely to continue at this level of minor unrest. Volcanic hazards remain about the summit craters area and the South East part of Ambrym Island e.g. major cracks from 2018 . Some volcanic hazards do remain on Ambrym specifically at the summit and eastern part of the Island. These are related to the presence of cracked areas. In addition to the summit hazards, the presence of active rifts and faults major ground cracking at the South East area of Ambrym are also hazardous, they will continue to be eroded and affected by earthquake activity. The danger zone for life safety at the summit area remains limited inside the Permanent Exclusion Zone at Benbow and Danger Zone A at Marum See Ambrym caldera safety map below . These danger zones are about 1 km around Benbow and 2 km around Marum craters including Maben Mbwelesu, Niri Mbwelesu and Mbwelesu. An additional danger zone at the South East of Ambrym remains within 500 meters from major cracks. Latest observations and daily analysis of the Ambrym seismic data from the volcano monitoring system confirm that the Ambrym volcano activity conditions remains stable and its activity is continuing at the low level of unrest. The lava lakes that used to appear in Benbow and Marum craters have disappeared since the December 2018 eruption. The remaining activity inside both craters consists of ongoing steam emissions. People from Ambrym and neighbouring islands will not see the volcanic glow at nights. Open cracks in the South East Ambrym that formed during the December 2018 eruption may continue to open due to erosion. Major earthquake activity could continue to affect these cracks and weak layers or areas around the actives craters. The Volcanic Alert Level VAL for Ambrym has been at the Level 1 since 10th October 2019. Observations of the current activity are consistent with the activity of the Volcanic Alert Level 1. Level 1 indicates ‘Minor level of unrest. Danger zone remains at 1 km around Benbow, 2 km around Marum and 500 meters from major cracked areas in the South East part of Ambrym’. With this current volcanic activity, it is a useful reminder that eruptions can occur at any level of unrest with little or no warning. Ambrym volcano is a very active volcano in Vanuatu with large caldera of 12 km in diameter and 2 active craters, Marum and Benbow. The volcano has been active during historical time at both summit and flank vents, producing moderate explosive eruptions and lava flows that have reached the coast. The larger events include eruptions in 1820, 1894, 1913 or 1929. Over the last seventy years before the 2018 eruption , there have been no eruptions that extended beyond the summit caldera. The eruption of 1988 and 2015 are focused in the caldera. The December 2018 eruption was focused in the summit caldera, and also affected the Eastern Fracture or Rift Zone with ground deformation, rifting, faulting and uplift, but no eruption occurred there. All tourism agencies, local authorities, people of Ambrym and the general public are reminded that due to the presence of cracked areas at the caldera, the danger zone remains at the Permanent Exclusion Zone at Benbow and the Danger Zone A at Marum which are set about 1 km radius from Benbow and 2 km radius from Marum. There are life safety hazards within these hazard zones. Due to the presence of active rifts and faults at the South East area of Ambrym, communities concerned are advised not to access within 500 meters from major cracks Danger Zone . There is a possibility low that earthquake or volcanic activity may start from this area. More information about the volcanic hazards can be found on the website https www.vmgd.gov.vu vmgd index.php geohazards volcano volcano info resources. The Vanuatu Meteorology and Geohazards Department continues to closely monitor this volcano activity. More information will be provided when necessary.

"More than twenty days have passed since the floods flattened their homes, destroyed all they had and left them in the middle of mud and stones. Most families are still in shock and disbelief. It was raining and as soon as I came out to the street, there was a horrible sound. I said to my neighbor, who was standing by, that it was flood, but he said it can't be. As the sound became closer and louder, we shouted at everyone inside to run. Said Hajiragha, who lost his mother and brother's wife on 26 August in Parwan province. Families did not only lose their homes and livelihoods but also their loved ones. A few were also severely injured. My mother served me as both my mother and father. I have never met my father as he died before I was born. It was time for me to serve my mother, but she is no more... Hajiragha added. With funding from European Commission Humanitarian Aid ECHO , DACAAR provides flood affected families with hygiene education on how to keep themselves and their family members safe and healthy during this natural disaster. DACAAR also delivers the families clean water for drinking and household use in addition to plastic garbage bags, and emergency baths and latrines. 1,271 flood affected families are regularly receiving this assistance in Parwan province and this will continue for 2 months until the families are able to pass the period of shock and start to rebuild their lives. My father, mother, grandfather, grandmother and two sisters died. One of my sisters is still missing. said Amina, a young female who is now the head of a 5 member family. The majority of flood displaced families are still seeking shelter and are in dire need of humanitarian assistance. I received a small tent for me, my brother and his one and half years old daughter, where we are living now. We are receiving oil, wheat and food items, but no one thought about how we can cook meals at the moment we have no place and kitchenware for cooking food. mentioned Hajiragha. The International Office of Migration's IOM initial information indicated that flash flood of 26th August 2020 severely affected more than two thousand families, killing at least 145 and injuring 167 in addition to severe damages to private houses, agricultural land and public infrastructure. Charikar city in Parwan province was one of the most affected locations among the 11 provinces where flash floods were reported.","['Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Land Slide']"
" A supercomputer funded by UK aid is helping countries in East Africa to tackle devastating locust outbreaks by tracking the insects’ movements around the continent. A supercomputer funded by UK aid is helping countries in East Africa to tackle devastating locust outbreaks by tracking the insects’ movements around the continent The computer based in Kenya uses data to predict where the locusts will move to and develop early warning systems so communities can prepare In addition, new UK aid to the UN will help stop the insects destroying the livelihoods of millions of people Climate experts in East Africa are using a UK funded supercomputer to combat the continent’s worst locust outbreak in 70 years, which is robbing people on the brink of starvation of much needed food. The supercomputer based in the regional climate centre in Kenya ICPAC uses satellite data to track dangerous locust swarms which in just one day can travel nearly 100 miles and consume the amount of crops that would otherwise feed 35,000 people. The innovative technology – supported by UK aid and the UK Met Office – also produces extensive weather forecasts to predict the high winds, rainfall, and humidity that provide ideal breeding conditions for locusts so climate experts can predict their next destination. By improving early warning systems we are helping charities and African Governments to take rapid action to protect vulnerable communities. The UK is also providing £5 million to an emergency UN appeal to help vulnerable communities in Kenya, Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan, South Sudan, Eritrea, Djibouti and Tanzania use this data to prepare for the arrival of locusts. This support will fund surveillance of the locusts and the spraying of aerial pesticides to kill the insects, protecting 78,000 hectares of land. The locust infestation – driven by longer rainy seasons and extreme weather – has already destroyed hundreds of thousands of hectares of vegetation in East Africa. This is decimating the livelihoods of farmers and worsening the humanitarian crisis in East Africa where close to 25 million people are on the brink of starvation. International Development Secretary Anne Marie Trevelyan said “The devastating locust outbreak in East Africa has paralysed communities that are already facing the daily threat of starvation. “Through UK aid and British expertise, we are helping to track, stop and kill dangerous swarms of locust to help millions of people fighting for survival. “With rising temperatures and increasing cyclones driving these infestations, Britain is stepping up to help vulnerable communities prepare for and adapt to the catastrophic impacts of climate change.” UK aid to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation FAO has already helped protect 73,000 hectares across East Africa, supplied almost 290,000 litres of pesticides and trained 600 people to carry out surveillance to stop the locust spread. On top of this, UK aid is helping vulnerable communities cope better with extreme weather by improving access to clean water, and providing drought resistant seeds, farming tools and nutrition packs to families. Notes to editors The supercomputer is being provided through the Department for International Development’s Weather and Climate Information Services for Africa WISER programme, in collaboration with the Met Office and the Africa Climate Policy Centre. The £35 million programme will run from 2015 until 2021 and will Help to build Africa’s resistance to climate change by implementing new policies and practices to plan for extreme changes in weather. Work to improve the quality of weather and climate information by bringing together experts and support its use on the continent. Provide expertise to improve climate forecasting ability and strengthen Africa’s response to climate change. UK aid will support the UN FAO Regional Emergency Appeal for the locust outbreak in East Africa. The FAO has initially asked donors worldwide for a total of £104million of funding of which the UK will contribute £5million. To fight this infestation, the UN Central Emergency Reserve Fund CERF has released £7.5 million to the FAO which has the skills and expertise in locust control to coordinate the response. The UK is the largest donor to CERF. With UK aid backed funding, the FAO is spraying pesticides on the ground and by air to prevent further damage to crops and protect livelihoods. The FAO is also working with governments in Africa, to train experts to manage future outbreaks and to conduct research to better understand the swarm.",['Insect Infestation']
"New Delhi, Mar 16, IRNA The untimely snowfall in Jammu and Kashmir claimed 17 lives and left nearly 2,000 houses damaged in Kashmir division, a high level review meeting chaired by Chief Minister Omar Abdullah was informed today. The meeting, convened to brief the Chief Minister about the situation following the recent heavy snowfall in state, was also told that 57 cattle perished in the calamity, the PTI reported quoting a spokesman as said. The chief minister directed officials to arrange helicopter sorties to evacuate people from snow bound areas. Omar was informed that 80 to 90 percent power supply had been restored in most of the areas, barring a few where severe damage had been caused to the installations. Transmission towers in Budgam, Shopian, Anantnag and other areas had received major damage and work was on to restore them. The Chief Minister was told that the power supply to various public service installations had been almost restored. Officials informed the CM that snow had been cleared from all major roads and work was on for clearing other roads. Clearance of landslides and snow on the national highway was on in full swing. Omar enquired about the dewatering operation in Srinagar city and around. He said since the fast melting snow would add to the problem, all resources needed to be mobilised for it. The Chief Minister was told that 175 water supply schemes in Jammu and 43 in Kashmir were affected. However, most of these had been restored. Officials told him that most of the areas hit by snow had adequate stock of essential commodities. He directed them to keep a close eye on the markets so that unscrupulous elements did not exploit the situation and create artificial scarcity of essentials goods.","['Cold Wave', 'Land Slide', 'Snow Avalanche']"
" THE GLOBAL COST OF LIVING CRISIS 1 in 9 people around the world are supported by money that is sent to them by family or friends living in other countries. These are called remittances and they are a lifeline for millions, supporting household spending on things like food and energy. Right now, the cost of living crisis is affecting many of us. From Beirut to Birmingham, people are struggling to cover the essentials and in March this year, global food prices in real terms reached an all time high. These issues are especially acute in the Horn of Africa. In Somalia, the price of milk, critical to child survival, rose by 140 in six months at the start of 2022. Coupled with issues of importing grain and fertiliser due to the war in Ukraine, ongoing conflict, and the worst drought in 70 years, the country is facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity. Right now, more than half of all children under 5 in Somalia are estimated to be suffering acute malnutrition. That’s when your muscles begin to waste away, your vision blurs, your immune system becomes dangerously weak and eventually your organs shut down. HUMANITARIAN SUPPORT Against this backdrop, the UK has cut its support to Somalia, from £233 million in 2020, to £90 million so far in 2022. Aid is lifesaving. It means humanitarian organisations like Save the Children can distribute peanut paste across rural communities to bring children back from the brink of death. But aid is only a part of the picture and won't solve the long term problems, the broken food system, the rising global temperatures and the ever widening gap between rich and poor. Remittances contribute a third of total GDP in Somalia, and amount to over three times the official development assistance and foreign direct investment worldwide. If UK remittances to Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia were free from costs for one year, £63 million more would go to families living there. That’s almost double the UN’s response fund. With yet another famine looming, now has to be a turning point for actually tackling these man made choices, exacerbated by poor political choices. JOINING UP That’s why, this month, we’ve launched a collaboration with four global remittance companies. Dahabshiill, Moneygram, Ria and Talk Remit. They are stepping up to reduce the fees they take when people are sending money to countries facing food insecurity. It’s a helpful short term measure but longer term solutions, where banks, Governments and development partners all step up to reduce the costs to remit need to be on the table. This would also help achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of reducing the cost of transferring money from 7 to 3 by 2030. It’s great to see four major companies step up to tackle the global hunger crisis in this way, and we call on others to join them.

This area is badly affected once again by Typhoon Lekima including the provinces of Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Hue, and Quang Ngai. The typhoon with strong winds of up to 130 km hour and heavy rainfall, particularly affected the provinces of Ha Tinh and Quang Binh on 3 and 4 October 2007. Six provinces were already under water as result of incessant rainfall over the three days before the typhoon struck. p In the aftermath of typhoon Lekima which caused considerable damage to infrastructure, heavy rain has hit the provinces of Quang Binh, Ha Tinh, Nghe An, Thanh Hoa, Ninh Binh, Hoa Binh and Son La. Extensive flooding occurred from 4 to 6 October 2007. One dam under construction in Thanh Hoa was damaged on the night of 4 Oct, inundating almost the entire communes of Tho Xuan and Thieu Hoa district. Evacuees of typhoon Lekima who returned to their homes were forced to re evacuate due to rising flood waters. A thousand more unable to be evacuated the same night were compelled to seek refuge on trees or roofs. River water overflowing the dykes has forced the evacuation of an additional 54,000 residents along the Ma River. p In the mountainous areas of the Nghe An province, deadly flash floods occurred due to severe damage to several small dams on the morning of 6 October, cutting off provincial roads. Flash floods also occurred in three other provinces, namely Yen Bai, Son La and Ninh Binh. p To date, the Central Committee for Floods and Storms Control CCFSC has reported 51 deaths and 14 missing persons while thousands of others have been directly affected by floods and need to be evacuated urgently. The local media has also reported the floods destroying over 80,000 hectares of rice and vegetable crops including Viet Nam Typhoon Lekima, Preliminary Emergency Appeal MDRVN002 2 aquaculture. An total of 5,971 houses have collapsed or been washed away, while about 51,794 have been flooded and damaged in 27 provinces of Viet Nam. In the Thanh Hoa and Ninh Binh provinces, more than 54,000 people and 32,000 others have been evacuated respectively. p Reports from local authorities show preliminary damage estimations given by some provinces. Among these are the Nghe An, Ha Tinh and Quang Binh provinces at a total of VND 575 billion CHF 42.9 million or USD 36.4 million while in Thanh Hoa province alone, total damages are calculated at VND 520 billion CHF 38.8 million or USD 33 million . p While damage estimates are not yet comprehensively available, it is confirmed that affected areas particularly Quang Binh, Ha Tinh, Nghe an, Thanh Hoa and Ninh Binh will suffer food shortages due to enduring serious flooding twice within two months. p Alerts and close watch messages have been sent from the Central Committee for Floods and Storms Control CCFSC to all these provinces in terms of rising river water level and dyke enforcement, in particular. p The central government has called for domestic and international contributions to help those affected. A total of VND 130 billion CHF 9.7 million or USD 8.2 million has been released by the central government to assist the 27 affected provinces in terms of flood response and evacuation. These comprise the Cao Bang, Ha Giang, Yen Bai, Lao Cai, Hai Duong, Bac Kan, Ha Tay, Son La, Bac Ninh, Hoa Binh, Binh Thuan, Hung Yen, Ha Nam, Nghe An, Quang Binh, Nam Dinh, Quang Tri, ha Tinh, Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Thai Binh, Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, Ninh Thuan, An Giang, Soc Trang and Ca Mau provinces. p Local authorities have mobilized thousands of military personnel to assist in evacuating flood affected people and strengthen structures such as the river dyke system, dams and other such edifices. p The National disaster management working group DMWG called for a meeting on Monday afternoon, 8 October to share information on initial damages and needs, and to form three joint assessment teams including VNRC to visit the hardest hit provinces of Ha Tinh, Nghe An and Thanh Hoa. Three teams will head out to do detailed assessment from Tuesday, 9 to Sunday, 14 October, followed by a debriefing meeting by all teams on Monday, 15 October. p Annually, the Viet Nam Red Cross with technical assistance from the Federation and contributions from the Japanese Red Cross, Netherlands Red Cross and Spanish Red Cross societies, implement community based disaster preparedness and disaster risk reduction activities. These include training of disaster preparedness for children, building preparedness capacity of the Red Cross, public awareness of disaster risk reduction and planting mangroves, bamboo, casuarinas trees, and such foliage. This planting is concentrated along the coastal areas of the Ninh Binh, Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Hue and Son La provinces. Some of the project sites are flooded but these districts are not among the most affected districts in those provinces thanks to good preparedness and response from both communities and Red Cross. p b Contact information b p For further information specifically related to this operation, please contact p Viet Nam Red Cross Mr. Doan Van Thai Secretary General , Phone 84 913.216.549, Email doanvanthai62 yahoo.com.vn Viet Nam country delegation Ms. Irja Sandberg Federation representative Mobile 84 904067955, Email irja.sandberg ifrc.org or Mr. Dang Van Tao, DM Manager , Phone 84 913.361.581, Email tao.vandang ifrc.org p Federation regional delegation in Bangkok Mr. Michael Annear Head of regional delegation disaster management unit , Bangkok, Phone 66 817539598, Email michael.annear ifrc.org p Geneva Secretariat Ms. Sabine Feuglet Southeast Asia desk officer Phone 41 22 730 4258 fax 41 22 733 0395, Email sabine.feuglet ifrc.org Mr. Flemming Nielsen Head of operations coordination Phone 41 22 730 4258 fax 41 22 733 0395, Email flemming.nielsen ifrc.org p Asia Pacific zone in Kuala Lumpur Ms. Amy Gaver Disaster management delegate , phone 60.3.2161.0892, fax 60.3.2161.1210, mobile 60.12.220.1174, email amy.gaver ifrc.org p Kuala Lumpur regional logistics unit Mr. Ilir Caushaj Regional logistics coordinator email ilir.caushaj ifrc.org phone 60.1.2628.2707 fax 60.3.2168.8573.",['Extratropical Cyclone']
"Unusually hot and dry conditions in parts of the northern hemisphere have been conducive to fires raging from the Mediterranean to – in particular – the Arctic. Climate change, with rising temperatures and shifts in precipitation patterns, is amplifying the risk of wildfires and prolonging the season. WMO’s Global Atmosphere Watch Programme has released a short animation http https youtu.be ZfJsedQlio0 which highlights the risks and explains how advances in satellite technology make it possible to detect and monitor fire dangers. Improving forecasting systems is important for predictions and warnings around fire danger and related air pollution hazards. In addition to the direct threat from burning, wildfires also release harmful pollutants including particulate matter and toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and non methane organic compounds into the atmosphere. Particles and gases from burning biomass can be carried over long distances, affecting air quality in regions far away. Heatwaves fuel fires Recent fires raging in Siberia were described as “unprecedented” https twitter.com m parrington for June in 17 years of the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service CAMS Global Fire Assimilation System GFAS https confluence.ecmwf.int display CKB CAMS Global Fire Assimilation System GFAS data documentation . This assimilates fire radiative power observations from satellite based sensors to produce daily estimates of biomass burning emissions which are part of the extensive measurements performed by many stations of the Global Atmosphere Watch GAW Programme. These measurements are essential for forecasts, research on atmospheric composition and to develop warning systems. Temperatures in Alaska hit record highs of up to 80°F 32°C in Alaska on 4 July, fuelling fires in the state, including along the Yukon River along the Arctic Circle. In Canada, smoke from massive wildfires near Ontario are producing large amounts of particulate matter, affecting air quality. The heatwave in Europe at the end of June also triggered wildfires in a number of countries, including Germany, Greece https emergency.copernicus.eu mapping list of components EMSR369 and Spain. Climate Change The northern part of the world is warming faster than the planet as a whole. That heat is drying out forests and making them more susceptible to burn. A recent study found Earth’s boreal forests are now burning at a rate unseen in at least 10,000 years http www.pnas.org content early 2013 07 19 1305069110 . Wildfires also release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere https gizmodo.com this could be the biggest threat to our climate if we d 1782663141 , contributing to global warming. For instance, the 2014 megafires in Canada scorched more than 7 million acres of forest, releasing more than 103 million tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere – half as much as all the plants and trees in Canada typically absorb in an entire year, according to a study by NASA. https www.nasa.gov feature goddard 2018 fires floods and satellite views modeling the boreal forest s future The pristine Arctic environment is particularly sensitive fragile and warming faster than most other regions. Particles of smoke can land on snow and ice, causing the ice to absorb sunlight that it would otherwise reflect, and thereby accelerating the warming in the Arctic. Fires in the Arctic also increase the risk of further permafrost thawing that releases methane, which is also a greenhouse gas. In view of the risks, WMO has initiated a Vegetation Fire and Smoke Pollution Warning and Advisory System to develop, implement and harmonize fire forecasting across the globe, providing a better picture of fires and related impacts and hazards everywhere.

The findings of the FAO WFP Special Report Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea , released on 24 July reinforced the view that some crop losses should be expected. The Mission observed low water levels in reservoirs, dry rice paddy fields and stressed maize. They also noted that rice was being planted late in some locations with farmers explaining that they were waiting for rain prior to planting. p p The Report also confirmed that temperatures in the spring were lower than normal, delaying the start of the growing season in some parts of the country. Conversely in May, June and July the temperature was markedly above normal, again affecting the growth of the crops. The Mission expressed the opinion that i '....early prospects for food grain production this year are poor and any recovery will depend heavily on the performance of rainfall during July and August. The latest information, however, indicates that as at mid July there had been no significant improvement in rainfall, whilst temperatures remained above normal' i . In August some heavy rains were experienced in most parts of the country. However, by this time the damage had already been done with rice plants having received little or no irrigated water and maize stunted. An additional concern was pest infestations. While these did not materialise in epidemic proportions some localised incidence of stem borer caused additional damage. At the 25th FAO Regional Conference for Asia and the Pacific the Secretary General of DPR Korea's National Committee for the Food and Agriculture Organisation said that severe drought in June and July had destroyed more than 400,000 ha. of land planted with rice and corn maize . FAO and WFP will undertake a detailed crop and food supply assessment in late September early October. p p A revised supply demand balance was included in the July Special Report p p class c5 Milled Cereal Balance Sheet November 1999 October 2000 '000 tonnes p div class c2 table border 1 tr valign top td width 352 b TOTAL AVAILABILITY b td td width 103 div class c4 3,420 div td tr tr valign top td width 352 Milled cereal Production br Potato Production in cereals equivalent br Stock draw down td td width 103 div class c3 2,930 br 490 br 0 div td tr tr valign top td width 352 b TOTAL UTILISATION b td td width 103 div class c4 4,751 div td tr tr valign top td width 352 Food Use br Feed Use br Other uses, seed and post harvest losses td td width 103 div class c3 3,814 br 300 br 637 div td tr tr valign top td width 352 b IMPORT REQUIREMENT b td td width 103 div class c4 1,331 div td tr tr valign top td width 352 Commercial import capacity br Emergency food aid delivered and pipeline br b u Uncovered deficit u b td td width 103 div class c3 210 br 586 br b u 535 u b div td tr table div p b TROPICAL STORM b At the end of August the north east of the country was seriously affected by the tail end of Typhoon Prapiroon known locally as Tropical Storm '12' . On 7 September the Humanitarian Co ordinator issued an initial report providing the observations of the UN system on the damage caused. The statement is attached to this Bulletin. In response the World Food Programme has provided 400 MT of food aid to be used as food for work in kind payment to citizens involved in the clean up and reconstruction operation. The IFRC and DPR Korea National Red Cross Society have undertaken a mission to the affected areas to provide relief items and make an initial assessment the results of which will be shared with other agencies upon their return at the end of this week. As noted in the report travel to the area is hampered by washed out bridges and roads and poor communications. Further information will be made available when known to Bulletin recipients and via the OCHA Disaster Response Branch Situation Report system. p p b ENERGY b While the focus for the humanitarian community during the summer months has remained on the crop situation other matters also remain of concern. In contrast to previous years, the usual respite from energy shortages has not been experienced this summer. There have been frequent power cuts and the general shortage of energy has compounded problems for the pumping of irrigation water to rice paddies, caused problems in the supply of domestic water, much of which is pumped to homes and apartments. Industrial production is also affected, as evinced by problems for local food production facilities to meet targets due to lack of electricity. p p b HEALTH AND NUTRITION STATUS b While no data has been provided by the Government on the health status of the population information gathered during monitoring visits indicates that general nutrition status has improved when compared with the same period in 1999. At the same time UNICEF notes that while cases of severe malnutrition are less prevalent than in previous years, the number of people who are moderately malnourished continues fall well outside norms. Additional concerns are now being expressed as the quality of the water delivery and purification systems deteriorates still further. Interventions made by agencies and NGOs are, of necessity, focused at the institutional level rather than at improvements to the overall system, which is in a state of crisis. p p EVENTS DURING JULY and AUGUST p p Following the Summit Meeting held in Pyongyang in June 2000, contacts continued between DPR Korea and the Republic of Korea in July and August. In mid August 200 families were reunited in Pyongyang and Seoul. Contacts also showed progress in the creation of additional links between the two countries. p p President Putin of the Russian Federation visited the country and held meetings on 19 July with senior state officials. At the end of his visit an agreement was concluded on mutual co operation in various fields. p p DPR Korea attended a meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum in Bangkok at the end of July. During the course of the meeting the DPR Korea Foreign Minister had meetings with a number of counterparts. p p OCHA Geneva issued the Mid Term Review of the United Nations Consolidated Inter Agency Appeal for DPRK for 2000. The Review noted that the Common Humanitarian Action Plan established in autumn 1999 remained valid and drew attention to the fact that the Appeal remained poorly funded, particularly in areas other than food aid. Monitoring of implementation of sectoral programmes and the established humanitarian principles was included in the document. p p A copy of the document can be obtained at the Reliefweb internet site a href http www.reliefweb.int http www.reliefweb.int a . p p In July an Australian delegation led by David Irvine, Australian Ambassador to China visited DPR Korea. The mission visited the Namyong salt pan which is the subject of an inter agency project involving WFP, UNDP and UNICEF. Ambassador Irvine presented his credentials to the DPRK government on 6 July 2000 thus formalising diplomatic relations between the two countries. p p A Canadian political mission visited DPRK in the second week of July. During their trip they had the opportunity to meet with members of the humanitarian community and Canadian nationals. p p During the second week of August a Japanese delegation arrived in DPR Korea to assess the distribution of Japanese donated rice. p p Mr. Nils Kastberg, UNICEF's Director of Emergency Operations, visited Pyongyang in July and met with UN agencies and NGOs to discuss common issues and opportunities to strengthen UN Interagency collaboration joint action in DPRK During his mission the Government and UNICEF concluded an agreed action plan to accelerate implementation of programmes during the mid year review exercise held on 10 July. The meeting also stressed the need for enhanced planning and operational preparedness for emergencies. p p FOOD SECURITY p p An appraisal team from the International Fund for Agricultural Development IFAD visited DPR Korea in August 2000 with a view to review a project for which an initial formulation mission had visited the country in April 2000 See Bulletin 2 2000 April . The August Mission focussed on two provinces and two counties within each province in North Hwanghae province, Koksan and Singye counties and in Ryanggang province Samsu and Phungso counties. The Mission confirmed the findings of the earlier IFAD mission and opted for the formulation of a project addressing sustainable increases in production through p ul type disc li Sustainable crop production systems li li Improvements in the quantity and quality of potato seed li li Preserving catchments through reforestation li li Providing credit to farmers li li Providing a fund for each cooperative to be covered by the project, to be used for productive purposes li ul br During discussions with the Government project management issues were covered as were matters concerning external technical assistance. WFP will provide support to this project through food for work programmes. Final project approval by the IFAD Board is anticipated by the end of the year. Total project value will be in the region of US 33,000,000. The programme also aims to provide a template for agricultural assistance development related programmes in DPR Korea for other development organisations considering assistance to the agricultural sector. p FAO continued to support the country's Double Cropping programme during July and August with the fielding of a technical expert. Thanks to donor support provided by Finland and Norway FAO was able to provide 30,000 litres of pesticides by the end of July for the protection of affected maize. Pesticides were applied to over 50,000 hectares under maize production at 415 co operatives included under the Double Cropping programme. An additional 14,300 litres are being applied at the beginning of September to reinforce protection. The programme will continue to be monitored by an FAO consultant due to arrive in mid September. At the same time FAO will assess the impact of the assistance provided in support of summer crops of the Double Cropping programme. p p FAO, UNDP and WFP launched an appeal to the international donor community in support of increased food production through double cropping for autumn winter wheat and barley production and spring cereals production. A total of US 10,400,000 is sought for this programme, of which US 5,500,000 is required urgently, mainly for fertiliser supplies for production of winter cereals. The project will be included in the upcoming United Nations Consolidated Inter Agency Appeal for DPR Korea for 2001, but was released early in order to provide donors with information upon which to base a timely response.

SDC will support 25 cooperative farms in the Miru area with 26 MT of wheat seed and 23 MT of Triticale. Wheat seed will be imported from China. Higher yields are anticipated through the introduction of Jingwang No. 10 seed and continued use of Jindong No. 8 and Beijing No. 411, both of which performed well during the last winter season. Triticale a man made variety created through crossing durum wheat with cereal rye is used as animal fodder and livestock grain. It has a high tolerance to drought and grows well in low fertility soils. Introduction of triticale provides farmers with diversification of animal fodders. SDC will support seed provision with 180 MT of urea and 240 MT of NPK fertilisers. p p In support of improved soil management SDC is supporting the upgrading of the Singye Agricultural station with the provision of an 80HP tractor, a plough, a disc harrow, a vibro cultivator, a heavy cultivator and a sowing machine. The primary use of the equipment will be for experiments and demonstration of techniques to ensure conservation tillage practices. p p SDC also supported a study tour for four senior scientists to agricultural research institutions in Germany and the Netherlands from 12 31 August. The group studied sustainable landscape management and soil fertility. Further study tours will be undertaken during the autumn, with a focus on maize breeding and post harvest techniques. p p SDC financed the travel expenses of three researchers from the Academy of Agricultural Sciences to Peru with a focus on training in True Potato Seed technology. p p Concern Worldwide reports that yields from its winter wheat project funded under the NGO Funding Mechanism in Anju and Pyongsong counties of South Pyongan province were affected by the adverse weather conditions experienced this summer. Average yields were only 1.5 MT ha with the best yield recorded as 2.2 MT ha. Inputs of 600 MT of fertiliser and 3 MT of delametrin pesticide for rice production for the same locations this summer have been provided by Concern however it is likely that yields will also be affected by the poor weather conditions. p p FOOD AID p p The World Food Programme Emergency Operation EMOP 5959.01 has been extended for a further 4 months to the end of 2000. EMOPs previously ran from July to June each year. However, in order to ensure that the results of the joint FAO WFP Crop Assessment are taken into account in formulating planning for 2001 and also to ensure parity with the United Nations Consolidated Inter Agency Appeals process, which runs from January to December each year, the new EMOP will commence on 1 January 2001 and run to the end of the year. p p WFP received donations from New Zealand US 191,000 and Ireland US 224,000 during July and 13,000 MT of wheat from the Government of Australia during August. b The cereals pipeline will run dry with effect from November 2000 if no new pledges are received.

However, in Ryanggang province north east WFP Emergency Officers observed that food distributions continued for workers and officials at the rate of 200g of barley per day during July. This distribution was due to the fact that food had not arrived in a timely manner and thus was distributed later than in other parts of the country where PDS distributions had been completed. In other parts of the country the PDS provided alternative foods, generally made from vegetables and edible grasses. div class c2 table border 1 tr valign top td width 494 Most hard hit have been people living in the north east, where there is very limited agricultural production. The coastal area was heavily reliant on industrial production which has contracted sharply due to the general economic problems facing the country. Industrial workers, dependent to a large extent on the PDS, have received only alternative foods and are facing considerable difficulties. 4,477 MT of food aid has been targeted to the north east to assist vulnerable populations. The Food Aid Liaison Unit distributed 12,500 MT of wheat to urban industrial workers in the north east. This food aid was well received by beneficiaries as expressed to FALU during follow up monitoring by the Head of the FALU Office and a delegation from the Canadian Food Grains Bank who visited DPR Korea during July. The Delegation, accompanied by Kathi Zellweger of CARITAS Hong Kong, also aimed to review the future strategy with regard to food aid shipments to DPR Korea. td tr table div p FALU received 32 MT of rice and 4 MT sugar from the Children's Home Society of Minnesota to be provided to baby homes, orphanages and boarding schools in North Pyongan province and Pyongyang.

Meeting participants gained knowledge on various processes required for the national review and reporting obligations for the statistical annex for the end of decade country report. Lessons and experiences were shared between participants from various countries in the region. The DPR Korea delegation faced certain constraints as they were unable to present a clean data file and thus could not produce the data tables necessary for discussion and interpretation as recommended by workshop facilitators. The Government expects the data from MICS2 to be ready by September, which will be undertaken solely by governmental ministries i the previous in country MICS Survey undertaken in 1998 was a cooperative venture between the Government and UNICEF . i p p Under the Expanded Programme of Immunisation EPI an application was made by the Government to the Global Alliances for Vaccines and Immunisation GAVI for the supply of vaccines for the immunisation programme. The submission of the application was supported with technical advice from WHO and UNICEF. Two officials from DPR Korea participated in a GAVI workshop together with staff from WHO and UNICEF between 24 and 26 July. DPR Korea was commended at the meeting for progress in the monitoring of acute flaccid paralysis AFP cases. At the same time other elements of AFP monitoring required improvement. Key follow up for DPR Korea is a strengthening of AFP surveillance and reporting on other EPI diseases, b improvement in the quality of national immunisation days with supervision by more partners, zero dose monitoring and ensuring complete coverage c improvement in the quality of routine coverage monitoring, using agreed formats d strengthening of mobilisation activities for EPI and e acceleration of action on the preparation of documents required for GAVI. p p In order to support the Central Hygiene and Anti Epidemic Institute, three members of the institute were provided with training in the Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicines in Beijing for 8 weeks in the May August period. The training was designed to develop their ability to undertake virological investigation of AFP cases and suspected polio cases. This activity is regarded as vital in the eradication of polio. p p Government officials also took part in WHO's seventh Technical Consultative Group TCG meeting on vaccine preventable diseases held in Calcutta from 24 26 August. Four staff from the Ministry of Public Health were supported by WHO to join a study tour to China from 17 22 July. The team was accompanied by the UNICEF Health Project Officer. The group visited Beijing and Shanghai. In Beijing trips were made to the WHO Polio Laboratory and the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicines. In Shanghai the team was able to visit the Shanghai Centre for Disease Control and the Chinese Academy for Preventive Medicines as well as the Institute for Parasitic Diseases. Key lessons learned and joint follow up will be discussed at a joint Government, WHO, UNICEF meeting to be facilitated by WHO. p p Thirty five doctors and midwives from provincial and central levels were trained on safe motherhood Life saving skills at a workshop held in Pyongyang from 7 11 August. UNICEF engaged two consultants from Nigeria to facilitate the training. p p Thirty technicians and managers from the Pyongyang Pharmaceutical Factory and Ministry of Public Health officials were trained on Good Manufacturing Practices to complement the factory's efforts to produce essential drugs including antibiotics and multi vitamins. Raw materials for local drug manufacture are being provided by Diakonie Emergency Aid and UNICEF. A pharmacologist from Indonesia was engaged to facilitate the workshop and produce training materials for the course work. p p Mr. Albert Petersen, Representative of Diakonie Emergency Aid visited DPR Korea from 31 August 3 September to review the essential drugs project supported by Diakonie and UNICEF. During the course of field visits Mr. Petersen was able to evaluate the impact of distribution of essential drugs produced locally and was positive about continuing assistance for the coming year. p p The Drug Manual, which provides practitioners with information on the essential drugs provided in the drugs kits distributed to health institutions, has been revised by UNICEF, WHO and IFRC. Some 20,000 copies of the revised version have been printed with additional information included on tuberculosis and malaria. The manuals are now being distributed in all operational areas. p p Under the District Health System project, which aims to improve community based health services, WHO provided 100 medical kits for safe deliveries were provided to ri district hospitals in North Pyongan and Chagang Provinces.

The effects of the storm are reported to be the worst in this area for 30 years. All of the east coast was affected, but the most serious damage appears to have occurred in North and South Hamgyong provinces in the north east corner of the country, particularly from Hamhung northwards. This has been witnessed by WFP staff located in sub offices in Chongjin, Hamhung and Hyesan, as well as by the UN Humanitarian Co ordinator who was travelling in the area when the storm struck. The north east part of the country has been continued to be most vulnerable in terms of food supply, so the effects of the storm will be especially pronounced. Damage from heavy rain has affected Ryanggang Province. The rest of the country also experienced heavy rainfall. Assessment by FDRC is ongoing but is severely hampered by inability to travel due to numerous road washouts, broken road and rail bridges and downed telephone lines making communications extremely difficult if not impossible. This has also delayed the reporting of the storm's damage by UN staff. At this stage damage to infrastructure appears more severe than damage to crops although these have also been affected, in contrast to the west coast tropical storms OLGA and NEIL of 1999 where crops were the main casualties. p p Some homes have been damaged or destroyed by floodwaters, mainly in rural areas. Information on loss of life is not yet complete but there is an initial report of 42 deaths in South Hamgyong caused when rivers burst their banks. Health needs and effects on water supply has not yet been fully assessed, except that the reservoir that provides drinking water to the city of Hamhung is reported to be damaged. Immediate needs are cash assistance for infrastructure repair works. The effect on the harvest will be assessed by the FAO WFP mission due late September. WFP is allocating food aid for food for work projects to assist provincial authorities to carry out emergency repairs. p p The Government has reacted quickly, and by 2 September several thousands of men and women were mobilised and were actively engaged in repair work. p p The full extent of damage to food crops in east part of the country has not yet been fully assessed but will be significant. Many areas of maize flattened by the strong winds have been observed as well as some areas where rice paddies have been flooded. In general, maize appears to be more affected than rice. p p Chongjin city has been under one meter of water in some parts. This has now receded and many hundreds of people have been mobilised and are busy clearing away one foot of mud and debris from streets. There is no loss of life reported in city area, other areas not reported. Until 7 September Chongjin had no contact with Pyongyang or other cities as telephone lines were cut in many places. p p On the route north of Chongjin, one major bridge has lost a span, but an alternative way through the river became possible for 4x4 vehicles on Saturday 2 September. The main road to Hyesan in Ryanggang province is impassible. p p A major road bridge seen at Kyongsong 30 km south of Chongjin in North Hamgyong Province has lost two concrete spans. This bridge is the only route South from Chongjin. The adjacent rail bridge is also not passable. The river here has spread over a large area perhaps 800 metres wide, destroying some homes. An alternative way through this river is being constructed. Another major bridge is down at Kumya, between Wonsan and Hamhung in South Hamgyong Province. An 8 km diversion is in operation here, but any rain shower renders it very difficult for truck traffic to pass and it is in any case narrow, so there is much congestion. p p In all, at least 21 washed out bridges were seen between Chongjin and Wonsan. There are innumerable washouts along the roads, of varying degrees of seriousness. All are now under repair by several thousands of men and women mobilised for this effort. Traffic is very seriously affected, and many hundreds of people are waiting probably for several days by the roadside for lifts on trucks, which have been delayed by the road conditions. p p The damage to roads and rail transport represent very serious problems as repairs will be extensive, expensive and lengthy. p p David Morton br UN Humanitarian Co ordinator br Pyongyang 8 September 2000 p p OCHA Office in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea br Munsudong, Pyongyang, DPR Korea br Tel 8502 3817298 Fax 8502 3817639 E mail ocha.dprk wfp.org p .",['Extratropical Cyclone']

" 81 of children report increase in violence during COVID 19 Children and young people from 50 countries warn of the surge in violence, child marriage and labour during the pandemic 81 of children say they have seen or experienced violence during the pandemic, with 82 saying COVID 19 has disrupted their education Children are urging world leaders to protect them from the rise in violence and consult them as nations respond to COVID Violence seen and experienced by children has surged worldwide during the COVID 19 pandemic, new research by international aid agency World Vision has found. ‘Act Now’, a child consultation study, reveals that more than four in five 81 per cent of those interviewed across 50 countries have seen or faced violence in their homes, communities or online since the start of the coronavirus outbreak. World Vision fears that if children are not heard and protected, even more children could be at greater risk. Figures suggest violence could increase by between 20 and 32 per cent in the future. Dana Buzducea, World Vision’s International Advocacy and External Engagement Leader says “This year has been particularly difficult for the most vulnerable children. Coronavirus has increased pressure and threats to children globally, especially in the most fragile contexts. It is clear we have another epidemic on our hands one of children facing increased violence.” Children and young people from 50 countries are calling on governments to protect them from this violence and to prioritise their rights as part of the global response to the pandemic. World Vision has already warned that up to 85 million children worldwide are at risk of physical, sexual and or emotional violence as a result of COVID 19 quarantines and restrictions, setting countries back decades in the fight against exploitation and violence against children. The study also found that the pandemic has prevented over 80 per cent of children from accessing education in some form. The young people interviewed urged governments to prioritise education as part of the global response to the pandemic. “In every crisis, children – especially the most vulnerable ones – pay the highest price. This is a crisis like no other and the pandemic has already decimated access to education, while vital child protection facilities such as schools, helplines and social groups have been completely inaccessible for many children who need them the most. The lockdowns that helped to slow down the spread of the virus have also locked children and young people into terrible conditions,” Buzducea added. More than 50,000 people including children have signed a World Vision global petition urging governments and institutions to increase funding for health, education and other social services that protect children from violence during the COVID 19 pandemic. So far, World Vision has reached 24 million children with education, child protection and food and livelihood support, as part of its 350 million USD response to the coronavirus pandemic. “Our experience shows that when empowered and supported, children are not passive victims but can be hidden heroes in times of need. Their input, their voices, their perspectives must be heard by decision makers. World Vision stands with children and young people as they demand that their rights are realised and we advocate for legitimate child participation and empowerment. Their voices are crucial as we work together respond to COVID 19 and build children’s lives back better in its aftermath,” Buzducea said. For more information or to organize an interview, please contact Carey Ellis, Media Comms Manager – M 07786 333 784 E carey.ellis worldvision.org.uk Notes to Editor World Vision interviewed 763 children and young people in six regions across Africa, Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe between April – August 2020. The children were aged 7 to 19 years old. To mitigate the immediate and longer term impacts of COVID 19 on families and children, and to ensure the safety of children and communities, World Vision has adapted how it works with a number of essential services and supports now temporarily provided remotely where possible. This includes remote case management, mental health and psycho social support, gender based violence prevention and response, parenting support, and remote learning resources and materials among other key interventions.

"KwaZulu Natal Premier, Sihle Zikalala, says substantial progress has been made in restoring water and power supply in areas affected by the recent floods. The Inner West Region is almost 90 restored. The Outer West Supply has improved from 45 to 95 . The Central Region has improved from 45 to 85 . The South Region has improved from 15 to 85 , while the North Region supply has moved from 15 to 60 , Zikalala said on Tuesday at a briefing. Zikalala expressed his gratitude to the Gift of the Givers foundation, which has donated 14 boreholes, with 11 already having been drilled. However, the Premier noted that while the restoration of water and electricity has reached over 90 overall, there remains a number of hotspots in the province. In Ilembe, KwaDukuza Water has no supply to the power generation plant due to plant repairs and this is affecting Shakaville and Lindelani. Mbozamo is still on the operating rule of closing water at night, Zikalala said. The Premier reported that the construction and restoration work on uThongathi Water Treatment Works is expected to take up to four months, with completion in September this year. He said a budget of at least R30 million has been allocated. eThekwini Municipality, Zikalala reported, has availed a number of mobile and static water tankers for self collection to service affected communities. Reviving the economy With regard to the development of flight routes, Zikalala said the province's recovery plans have been severely hampered by the recent closing down of British Airways and Kulula. He, however, welcomed the report by the Department of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs under MEC Ravi Pillay that hotel occupancy rates are gaining traction and recovering from the recent floods. Zikalala assured that water challenges at King Shaka International Airport have been addressed and long term plans are in place to increase water supply through boreholes to insure against any future emergency. Repairs are also underway to key attractions such as the Mandela Capture Site, the two world heritage sites Howick Falls and the beachfront as part of the recovery and reconstruction process. The Bayhead Road repairs are progressing very well, with the execution of earthworks now in full throttle. Bluff Road is being used for fuel cargo in the interim, and we are pleased to note that the container terminal has addressed its entire backlog and has released 100 of the delayed imported cargo, the Premier said. With regard to rail infrastructure, Zikalala said the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa PRASA has announced plans to resume the Umlazi service line on 1 September and KwaMashu line on 9 September 2022. Cell phone networks, Vodacom and MTN, which were affected by the floods, have also reported that over 80 of damaged infrastructure is now back in operation. However, the Premier said the telecommunications sector has raised its concerns about ongoing vandalism of its infrastructure, and the repair of roads and electricity supply to speed up the restoration of communication services. On support for business, the Premier announced that the provincial Economic Development and Environmental Affairs Department is leading the provision of funding to 394 businesses that have applied for assistance, which is currently valued at R196 million. The applications are mainly from companies in the agriculture, services and manufacturing sectors, said Zikalala. Transport infrastructure Zikalala said damage to KZN transport infrastructure from the recent floods amounts to R6 billion, including the M4 and R102. He reported that the South African National Defence Force is installing bailey bridges, while the KZN Department of Transport DOT is leading a massive project called Valamapotholes patching potholes programme , working together with municipalities. In the medium term, 730 key projects have been approved throughout the province to be implemented through emergency procurement, which includes the closure of potholes and repairs to damaged roads. KZN DOT has submitted 49 bridge sites to the national Department of Public Works for consideration for the bailey bridges programme. The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development is assisting households and farmers with regard to soil testing services, provision of lime, fertilisers, tools, fencing, water tanks, re gravelling and repairing damaged roads and the construction of culverts. The objective is to resuscitate livestock operations on affected farms and support sugar cane, and the implementation of biosecurity measures, Zikalala said.","['Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Mud Slide']"
"Eight people are confirmed to have died in the Highlands and Morobe as a result of the long dry spell and frost in Papua New Guinea. These include five children and an elderly man in Chimbu and two in Morobe Province. Two other children are reported to have died in Hela Province. The Government's Chief Secretary, Sir Manasupe Zurenuoc, has received the assessment reports on the drought on Mt Wilhelm, Chimbu Province and frost disaster in Tambul Nebilyer, Western Highlands Province. He says 56,000 people in Tambul Nebilyer are in urgent need of relief assistance. District Administrator, Douglas Lingawa says the two major rivers Kagul and Ambonga have dropped to a severe drying level. He says frost has damaged all crops like breadfruit, cabbages and broccoli. Livestock such as pigs and fish are also threatened. Sir Manasupe has urged all disaster hit provinces and districts to provide an assessment report of the population affected and the scale of the damages caused by the disaster so the government can help. The National Agricultural Research Institute predicted this disaster in 2009, saying the temperature in Tambul Nebilyer is likely to drop to 1 degree celcius in the coming weeks. According to the ABC, regional weather emergencies like the drought and frost currently impacting PNG and drought in Solomon Islands, are being put down to the increasing impact of the latest El Nino weather pattern. It’s being called, by a NASA Scientist, a potential Godzilla El Nino, that could yet turn out to be the strongest in recorded history. Mike Elphat of the United States Climate Prediction Center said, a monster El Nino is a dramatic description but the event is definitely strengthening. “There is a most more concrete examples of what climate change is doing and to try to link an El Nino like this and you know, we had a very big El Nino in 97 98.There was a big one in 1982 83 so you know I certainly hope that this particular El Nino doesn't get drag into the Climate Change droughts”. Meanwhile, PNG National Disaster Centre says it will deploy teams to the Highlands region to check the areas affected by El Nino by early next week. Director Martin Mose told a media briefing in Port Moresby there will be four teams of strategic partner authorities that should have a report to verify the situation on ground. This is so that the NDC can coordinate and spend resources accordingly to assist the people in need. He also said the National Disaster Centre has requested K5 million US 1.7 million from the National Government as response to the heavily affected Highlands region. With reports of lives being lost in the Highlands due to the harsh conditions of El Nino, the NDC intends to utilise the K5 million as a response measure to assist people in the four badly affected Highlands Provinces. “We are now deploying we cannot wait for more lives to be lost. Really it is a wakeup call for the provincial administration to start organising themselves, the disaster centre director said. “It is better that NDC verifies the reports that were sent in by provinces so that we know exactly what is required and what’s not. So that is why it’s important our teams go and verify because at the end of the day, it is the taxpayers’ money going down so we want to see that those monies are spent wisely.” He said Chimbu was the first Highlands Province to send in its report on the El Niño. Mose clarified that so far the NDC has not set a proper budget yet for the El Nino disaster but will do so as soon as reports are compiled by the assessment teams.

In the reporting period, UNICEF secured a total of USD 59,000 to support the re establishment of early childhood intervention services.","['Earthquake', 'Epidemic']"
"JOHANNESBURG, 27 March 2012 IRIN The apocalyptic vision presented on cinema screens of a world devoid of food Hunger Games or with too much water Waterworld as a result of climate change, is not as far fetched as some may think. The results of a new study by the world’s biggest climate modelling system show that not only could global temperatures cross the two degrees Celsius barrier, but may warm by three degrees Celsius by 2050 if we emit atmosphere warming gases at the current rate. The study, led by Oxford University’s Dan Rowlands posits a substantial increase in global temperatures within little more than a generation. Most recent warnings, including those by the UN Environment Programme UNEP , are more ambiguous, saying a two degree hike is almost certain “by the turn of the century”. The world authority on climate science, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC , says in its latest assessment that a two degree Celsius increase in global temperatures by the turn of the century would have a catastrophic effect water stress in arid and semi arid countries, more floods in low lying coastal areas, coastal erosion in small island states, and the elimination of up to 30 percent of animal and plant species. A degree warmer The decade 2001 2010 was the warmest since records began in 1850, with global land and sea surface temperatures estimated at 0.46 degrees Celsius above the long term average 1961 1990 of 14 degrees Celsius, said the World Meteorological Organization WMO in 2011. Linking the 0.46 degrees Celsius hike to man made emissions of greenhouse gases, WMO noted an increase in “dramatic and continuing sea ice decline in the Arctic”, that global average precipitation was the second highest since 1901, and that flooding was reported as the most frequent extreme event. Two exceptional heatwaves hit Europe and Russia in 2003 and 2010 respectively, causing thousands of deaths and outbreaks of prolonged bush fires. Studies have shown that the heatwaves in Europe and Russia had become likely because of man made climate change. Temperature rise will not necessarily be uniform. “While the global average temperature may be warmer by three degrees Celsius in some areas the change might even be double that,” explained Rowlands. Deserts, for instance, warmed up between 1976 and 2000 at an average rate of 0.2 0.8 degrees Celsius per decade an overall increase of 0.5 to two degrees Celsius much higher than the average global temperature increase of 0.45 degrees Celsius, which has been attributed to the increase in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, according to UNEP. The four degree scenario In 2009, various papers presented at an Oxford University conference entitled “4 degrees and beyond” forecast a collapse of the agriculture system in sub Saharan Africa in such a scenario. Various studies have suggested that most of southern Africa would have given up on maize or even farming every home in Asia and Africa would be trying to harvest some rain water and most parts of many low lying countries like Bangladesh would probably be under water. “To me, the main message is that the main estimates of global temperature trends are broadly consistent with the IPCC Fourth Assessment, but with still the possibility of some more extreme outcomes,” said Maarten van Aalst, director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre and coordinating lead author of the summary of the special report on Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change SREX , produced by IPCC in 2011. “Even more important to humanitarian organizations is… what happens to heatwaves, floods and droughts?... As the IPCC SREX demonstrated, our knowledge is advancing on that front as well, although uncertainties remain high. For many hazards in many regions, the main message is that we need to plan for a more uncertain future.” IPCC’s projections for global temperature increase show that if emissions of global greenhouse gases remain unchanged, a hike of 2.2 degrees Celsius is possible by 2050. A thorough study The Rowlands study found that global warming of three degrees Celsius by 2050 was just as plausible as a rise of 1.4 degrees, meaning that the world should prepare for either scenario. The study ran 10,000 simulations of the impact of several variables which affect the rate of absorption of heat by the oceans, impact of aerosols from air pollution on climate and the sensitivity of temperatures to increasing carbon dioxide concentrations to come up with the most thorough study on climate change projections yet. The 10,000 simulations were run on computers in people’s homes through climateprediction.net as part of a BBC Climate Change Experiment. Climateprediction.net is a computing project which aims to produce predictions of the Earth's climate up to 2100 and to test the accuracy of climate models. The more simulations you run of what the weather could be like, the greater the chances of a credible projection. The project, which began in 1999, is based on the premise that running the model thousands of times will help to find out how the model responds to small changes in data. It also helps scientists to run a wide range of different scenarios. It called on ordinary citizens to donate time on their computers. All people had to do was download a climate model setup to run in the background on their home computer, returning the results to a central server after a week or so. “There are about 90,000 active volunteers at climateprediction.net ,” said Daithi Stone, a scientist at Berkeley Lab Computing Sciences. Stone worked with the climateprediction.net team to set up a project at the University of Cape Town to run a regional model over southern Africa on home PCs. This weatherathome project has so far produced 85,000 years of high resolution modelling over southern Africa, with the help of 433 volunteers based in South Africa. How to take part You can take part in the weatherathome SAF project, explained Stone. “Go to http weatherathome.org, register, and then download a climate model simulation. This runs in the background on the computer when it is not in use, or when they are using it for something not very demanding like email. There is some visualization software that comes with the model, so you can watch the weather develop over southern Africa and the rest of the planet. “Each simulation takes about a week on today's computers, and at the end the programme will upload the results of the simulation back to a central server where researchers can access the data for analysis. Once a simulation is finished, another one can be downloaded and run, so it can very much be a continuous contribution.” jk cb.","['Flood', 'Heat Wave']"

" Highlights • 25 of the 34 provinces in Afghanistan are above the emergency threshold for acute malnutrition in 2019. More than one third of Afghans are facing severe crisis or emergency level of food insecurity in 2019 IPC, Aug 2019 . • The National Assessment of the Prevention of Child Recruitment in Afghanistan conducted in 2019, found out that 1 in 100 families had at least one child recruited in armed forces during the last five years. Out of 10 children who joined armed forces, 1 got killed or went missing, 3 are still in armed forces and 6 returned and are in need of reintegration support. • Direct targeted attacks on health care facilities and health care workers have increased in 2018 and 2019. • 84 healthcare providers and 258 healthcare facilities were severely affected. As a consequence, more people especially children and women now are denied access to basic health services than ever before WHO, 2019 . • 488 schools remain closed due to insecurity depriving around 146,400 children’s right to education. • UNICEF and partners provided over 674,000 affected children and families with integrated lifesaving assistance such as WASH, Nutrition, Health Education, Child Protection and distribution of none food items. • UNICEF WASH has constructed, as part of durable solution, two solar powered water networks to drought affected displaced people in formal IDP settlement in Herat province covering 46,000 people since May 2019. Funding Overview and Partnerships UNICEF had appealed for US 50 million in 2019 to sustain the provision of life saving services for children and women in Afghanistan. During the course of the year, UNICEF received US 18 million including US 7 million of carried over funds from 2018. The governments of the United States, Denmark, Japan, Italy, Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund AHF , Central Emergency Response Fund CERF , UNICEF Denmark, UNICEF USA, and UNICEF Italy generously contributed to UNICEF Afghanistan’s humanitarian response. UNICEF expresses its sincere gratitude to all donors for the contributions received. However, by year end, the 2019 Humanitarian Action for Children still had a funding gap of 51 per cent against the appeal. Significantly under funded programmes include health and education while WASH received over 75 per cent funds. To meet the immediate response needs, UNICEF reallocated over US 15 million from internal core resources and other resources OR to provide urgent and life saving assistances. Inadequate funds compromises UNICEF’s efforts in providing timely and effective humanitarian actions. Situation Overview Humanitarian Needs Humanitarian needs in Afghanistan continued to rise in 2019 due to the ongoing conflict coupled with natural disasters and insufficient investments public systems for basic services. The conflict has a direct and indirect impact on the physical and mental status of affected populations and compromise the capacities of service providers and humanitarian interventions. During 2019, over 440,000 individuals fled their homes due to conflict. A total of 32 out of 34 provinces recorded some level of forced displacement. With reference to UNOCHA report 2019, a total of 119 incidents involving humanitarian aid workers were reported, compared with 102 during 2018 and 325 access related incidents were reported in 2019 whereas 380 access restrictions were reported in 2018. The Presidential elections held in September 2019 saw an escalation in violence and movement restrictions. United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan UNAMA ’s indicates that attacks targeting the electoral process caused 458 civilian casualties 85 deaths and 373 injured , including 277 civilian casualties 28 deaths and 249 injured on polling day with forty five per cent of all civilian casualties on polling day being women and children. With election results pending to be released in 2020, the situation is likely to be volatile. In 2019 alone, eighty four 84 healthcare providers were severely affected by attacks of which 18 killed, 31 injured, 27 detained of which only 8 were released . Moreover, 258 healthcare facilities were affected with six healthcare facilities destroyed, 26 damaged, 192 closed of which 34 were reopened . 2018 drought continued to affect the nutrition situation and it is estimated that 14.3 million people would be either in crisis or at emergency levels of food insecurity in 2020. People are consistently affected by floods, harsh winter and landslides every year. Poor shelter and unhygienic conditions, particularly in displacement, leave people especially newborns and infants vulnerable to disease with harsh winter and floods. The joint Afghanistan winterization strategy highlighted that over 665,000 individuals will be in need of winterization assistance during 2019 2020 winter season. While Afghanistan has made progress towards improving children’s access to education, continued conflict, poverty and targeting of schools has put more stress on an already over burdened education system. About one third of school aged children, approximately 3.7 million children remain out of school. Despite continued efforts by humanitarian agencies, rising insecurity and armed clashes are posing challenges to programme implementation and monitoring.","['Cold Wave', 'Drought']"
" Highlights • According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification IPC analysis released in December 2020, approximately 104,000 people will likely face catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity between December 2020 to March 2021 in six at risk counties. • During the period January to February 2021, a total of 32,684 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition SAM were treated in inpatient and outpatient therapeutic programs. The performance indicators for SAM treatment were above the acceptable minimum SPHERE standards, with a cure rate of 95.9 per cent, a death rate of 0.3 per cent and a defaulter rate of 2.0 per cent. • According to the Ministry of Health, a total of 8,010 COVID 19 cases were reported as of the end of February 2021 100 per cent increase from the cumulative cases that were reported during the period April 2020 to January 2021 . Cumulatively, a total of 94 deaths have been recorded since the beginning of the outbreak. As a key member of the national vaccine technical working group TWG , UNICEF continued to provide technical support in the preparation and implementation of the national deployment and vaccination plan for COVID 19. Situation Overview Humanitarian Needs Two years after the signing of the revitalized peace agreement, women and children in South Sudan continue to be faced with multiple risks which include extreme food and nutrition insecurity, residual impact of floods, localized conflict, an ongoing economic crisis and disease outbreaks including COVID 19. As of 28 February 2021, a cumulative total of 8,010 confirmed COVID 19 cases and 94 deaths had been recorded in South Sudan with a case fatality rate CFR of 1.2 percent. The country had conducted over 110,226 COVID 19 tests since the beginning of the outbreak. Overall the food and nutrition situation has worsened, and some communities are facing catastrophic needs. According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification IPC assessment results shared in December 2020, in the first projection period of December 2020 to March 2021, an estimated 5.82 million people 48.3 per cent of the population will likely face Crisis IPC Phase 3 or worse acute food insecurity, with 11,000 people likely to be in Catastrophe IPC Phase 5 acute food insecurity in Pibor County in Pibor Administrative Area. During this period, an estimated 1.79 million people are likely to face Emergency IPC Phase 4 acute food insecurity. More children are expected to be acutely malnourished than in the past three years. Approximately 1.4 million children under the age of five are expected to suffer from acute malnutrition in 2021, including 313,391 children who are projected to suffer from severe acute malnutrition. The estimation of the nutrition caseload was based on seasonal historical data from food security and nutrition monitoring systems, SMART nutrition surveys and the admission trends for 2020. Several attacks against personnel in the humanitarian community were reported during the reporting period. An attack against a vehicle carrying a polio vaccination team in Lakes state on 14 February, resulted in three deaths and 4 injuries of humanitarian personnel. Earlier in the month, an International NGO staff member was killed in Unity State, after he was force marched from a vehicle and shot as the team were returning from a distribution site. Dry season intercommunal violence continued to be the most significant country wide threat to humanitarian operations. There has been an increase in violence in Warrap and Lakes States as well as sub national conflict in Upper Nile. The appointment of State Level Governments in seven of the ten States may ease some political tension but it is too early to make definitive conclusions.","['Drought', 'Epidemic', 'Flood', 'Other']"
" Key messages Market prices for staple foods remain high, and as such household food insecurity, that is both availability and access persist for the most vulnerable especially in parts of Red Sea, Kassala, East, West and North Kordofan, East, Central and West Darfur, Gedaref and Blue Nile states faced crisis levels of food insecurity IPC Phase 3 . Of grave concern also are Internally displaced persons in parts of South Kordofan and conflict affected households of Jebel Mara in Darfur who continue to be at risk of emergency levels of food insecurity IPC Phase 4 . Heavy flooding across Sudan has severely affected at least 346,000 people including partially or totally damaging their homes, according to OCHA. It has been forecasted that the rains will persist until October and thus the risk of flooding remains high. Affected households require urgent support in the form of essential relief supplies for survival. According to OCHA Sudan, the risk of water borne disease outbreaks remains high in the floods affected areas, due to the heavy rains and flooding that have been experienced in most parts of the country. OCHA estimates that the number of people in need has risen from 4.4 million in early 2019 to 8 million, with concerns raised that this number could increase further. World Vision, therefore, appeals for your continued support during this transitional period and beyond, in order to provide support to people in dire need of humanitarian assistance.","['Epidemic', 'Flood', 'Severe Local Storm']"
"In the mountainous regions of Nepal, this year’s monsoon season has triggered 44 recorded landslides in areas that are still trying to rebuild from the devastating earthquake of 2015. So far in 2020, 64 people have been killed and more than 1,700 families have been displaced in the Sindhupalchowk, Dhading, and Gorkha districts – all while coping with the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic. Unfortunately, Nepal has not succeeded in effectively mitigating landslide risks, with haphazard road construction and climate change making the situation worse. In addition to death toll, the landslides have also caused severe damage to property, devastated livestock, and wiped out arable farmlands. Krishna Bahadur Newar found his home in Barhabise, Sindhupalchowk swept away by a recent landslide It's really difficult for me to think about the incident the loss that I suffered is unfathomable,” Newar says “The sudden landslide not only took away my home and property but also my wife, leaving me and my injured son all alone. I was frightened and furious at the same time for losing everything. In response to the landslides and with humanitarian funding from the European Union https ec.europa.eu echo index en , People in Need PIN along with its local implementing partner, Phase Nepal https phasenepal.org , launched the “Landslide Emergency Response Project.” The project team was amongst the first to respond to the recent landslides, deploying immediately after they occurred to carry out an identification and mapping exercise in close collaboration with local officials. The aim was to assist the most affected people with their immediate needs. During the pandemic, we dispatched our team to the affected districts with an eye toward the COVID 19 situation. The needs of the people we met ranged from shelter and enough clean and warm clothing, to essential provisions for new born babies. Consultations with locals indicated that they feared further torrential rains amidst the COVID 19 crisis. One hundred households were identified as internally displaced, and were prioritised for emergency assistance with temporary shelter kits, consisting of basic materials such as corrugated galvanised iron CGI sheets, plain sheeting, and tarpaulins. Pregnant and lactating women received WASH dignity kits to help them maintain their basic hygiene, as well as to safeguard the health of their children. In total, 116 households with pregnant and lactating women received kits with essential items such as soap, dental items, towels, baby clothing, diapers, and undergarments. The kits also included COVID 19 prevention provisions such as hand sanitiser and face coverings. An additional 156 non food items kits – including basic winterisation items such as blankets, sleeping mats, kitchen sets, and solar powered flashlights – were distributed to the most vulnerable households. Dan McNamara, Head of Programmes for PIN Nepal, explains the urgency of the situation Five years on from the devastating earthquake, landslides continue to hit the most vulnerable. Unable to return home, families without safe shelter and secure livelihoods are left behind to pick up the pieces. Emergency shelter and WASH provisions allow families to get back on their feet at a time of immense uncertainty, exacerbated by the current COVID 19 pandemic. PIN and the EU Humanitarian Aid's support is just the start, with much more needed if landslide survivors are to secure a dignified and meaningful recovery. Hope amidst crisis Bimala Century, 27, is six months pregnant and lives with her three children in a village in Dhading, while her husband works as a labourer in Butwal City, more than 140 kilometres away. Her house was completely destroyed by the landslide. “After the house was damaged, I moved to my maternal home in another village for immediate housing,” she says. “I am a poor Dalit woman raising three children with the money my husband earns working as labourer. Although many people received relief items as part of the initial government support , I was not on the list for assistance since I wasn’t present and no one informed me. I am very happy that I was included in the distribution programme led by PIN. Thanks to PIN and the ward office, I was able to repair my house with the shelter materials I received, and celebrate Dashain in my own home.” PIN, in partnership with the European Union, continues to support vulnerable communities affected by landslides in the Sindhupalchowk, Dhading, and Gorkha districts with COVID 19 WASH interventions, including the installation of gender segregated community latrines and water stations to provide access to clean and safe facilities and drinking water, together with a catalogue of complementary hygiene promotion activities.

"Caritas Kenya is supporting survivors of a huge fire that devastated the Sinai slums in the Kenyan capital Nairobi on 12 September. Over a hundred people were killed and a hundred more injured after a pipeline burst and leaked fuel into the Ngong river, which passes through this slum area. Kenya Pipeline Company managing director Selest Kilinda blamed a faulty valve. People from the densely populated shanties had already started siphoning the fuel when the fire started. People cooking close to the pipeline may have sparked off the inferno. A group of Caritas staff members and church leaders visited the site of the disaster and met with survivors in a temporary camp and those with serious burn injuries in the hospital. The camp hosts about 200 men, women and children. Caritas Kenya jointly with Caritas Nairobi donated food items, blankets and mosquito on 14 September in the camp. Rt. Rev.

A statement by the Bishops Conference said the scale of the tragedy was of unheard of proportions and urged the Kenya government to take greater responsibility in preventing future disasters. “The government must in effect take full responsibility to transform the living environments of the citizens,”it said. The statement urged political leaders to be the agents of development in the country and not of corruption and poverty. A similar tragedy occurred in Sachang’wan in 2009 when two people were killed as they scrambled to collect spilt fuel, and the Kenyan bishops say this shows there is an urgent need for civic education about the inherent dangers.",['Fire']

As part of the recovery program for the Ambae repatriates, the Water and Sanitation Cluster are cleaning and testing water quality in wells, tanks and carrying out water and sanitation awareness at the same time. “Though a few wells have been declared safe, there is still fear of it still being contaminated as acid rain continuously falls especially in the West and Southern part of Ambae.” “The acid rain is a new thing to live with for the people of Ambae” says officer Manson. “Its negative impacts can already be seen in the growth of vegetables like cabbages and thus forcing some to move further North to the coastal areas.” In regards to food, the Food and Agriculture Organisation will be providing technical assistance this week while the Health cluster continues to monitor any possibility of a disease outbreak. Most of the people of Ambae are consuming foods beared above ground like bananas if not too spoilt by acid rain, before moving to consuming root crops. Meanwhile, root crops are slowing being dug up everywhere by animals. “The current needs at this time would have to be water, food and Awareness programs” states Manson. “The supply of food and healthy water is crucial at this time for their survival and they eed to know how to better adapt to the current situation through awareness programs.” The disaster committee and the provincial government is currently seeking for NGO’s assistance towards Ambae’s long term plan.",['Volcano']

While urban areas face stark challenges amidst the pandemic and hurricane, Direct Relief’s Erick Molina, who focuses on program operations in Latin America, said he is even more perturbed about the situation in the rural and remote areas of Honduras, especially in the eastern part of the country. “Visiting Honduras, I was able to see the challenges there regarding the country’s healthcare system, especially in rural areas. During Covid 19, several isolated regions had to fend for themselves, and that’s without any natural disaster hitting. I’m especially concerned about people living close to river banks, many of whom live in huts, and next to mountains, because of potential landslides,” Molina said, echoing responses from Honduran health care providers he had been in touch with in recent days. “The situation in the country worsens even more because with the Covid 19 pandemic is not controlled and the collapsed public hospitals are not giving a response to the population when they seek medical attention,” said Restrepo. At Hospital Loma de Luz, a nonprofit evangelical Christian missionary hospital located in the remote, coastal municipality of Balfate in northern Honduras, operations are ongoing thanks to a generator, as electricity in the community is out. Emergency, chronic, and Covid 19 patients are all being seen, according to Alisa Geers, a registered nurse who works at Loma de Luz. Continuing to see patients has not been easy, as trees are blocking roads to the hospital and many staff live in a hard hit area. “About one third of the hospital staff live in a community on the other side of Rio Estaban, which has flooded and stranded the area as no one has been able to pass through for over 24 hours,” Geers said. The hospital is also helping in other ways, and has housing available for some patients and staff, should their homes be damaged. They also have a supply of clean water for the community. “Even in storms if the pipes get clogged there can be a water shortage,” Geers said. Immediate requests from Direct Relief’s partner health care facilities in Honduras included over the counter medicines like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, antibiotics, anti parasite medicine, masks, alcohol gel, and hygiene items. An infusion of the requested medical aid is being prepared at Direct Relief’s warehouse and expected to depart this week for impacted areas. “The whole situation in the country is going to get complicated, we will be in a state of economic crisis for a long time,” Restrepo said. Since 2010, Direct Relief has sent more than 446 million worth of medicines and medical supplies to health care providers in Nicaragua https www.directrelief.org place nicaragua and Honduras https www.directrelief.org place honduras to help support their care of vulnerable populations.

"This week's horrific blast in Beirut has brought into sharp focus the need for the international community to step up and help Lebanon and its people at their time of crisis. Only a swift international response and sustained engagement will prevent many more lives being lost. Four weeks ago, the High Commissioner issued a stark warning that the situation in Lebanon was fast spiralling out of control. Then, she urged the Government, political parties and leaders to enact urgently needed reforms and to address essential needs such as shelter, food, electricity, health and education. In her statement https reliefweb.int node 3651996 on July 10, the High Commissioner pointed to the situation of the most vulnerable. Today, every Lebanese is weighing how they will manage going forward after the triple tragedy of the socio economic crisis, COVID 19 and the ammonium nitrate explosion. With large swathes of the city unfit to live in, the country's principle port all but destroyed and the health system on its knees, the situation is dire. Victims' calls for accountability must be heard, including through undertaking an impartial, independent, thorough and transparent investigation into the explosion. As the city and the country rebuilds, the need to protect the rights of the poorest and most vulnerable through collective action and reform, will be more important than ever. This tragic event must be a turning point for the country's leaders to overcome political stalemates and address the grievances of the population first aired during the protests in October 2019.

"BEIRUT, 17th May 2021 In the wake of the Beirut port blast, the European Union EU provided EUR 5 million in humanitarian support to 5 organisations to address the emergency needs of more than 13,000 affected people between October 2020 and April 2021. European Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarčič, said “ After first providing disaster relief, the EU was committed to meet the emergency needs of people directly impacted by the explosions. It was important to support capable humanitarian organisations on the ground and address the inhabitants’ most urgent needs shelter, psychological help or cash for food and other essentials .” Over 7 months, an EU supported consortium consisting of the non governmental organisations NGOs ACTED, Arcenciel, Lebrelief, Concern Worldwide and Intersos provided shelter rehabilitation for people’s homes, psychological support as well as emergency assistance to small and medium businesses. Mona, a Lebanese resident of Mar Mkhael neighbourhood in Beirut said “The NGO consortium did all the needed repairs after the explosion doors, windows, tiles and even the bathroom. We really appreciated their work. We did not want to leave our house, all our memories are in it. The wooden door flew across the room, it was chaos, glass and furniture pieces everywhere. We could not have done the repairs ourselves we did not have the energy or the money.” Over half the Lebanese population lives below the poverty line, in addition to about 1.5 million Syrian refugees who are mostly living in extreme poverty. People’s ability to work has been hampered due to the severe economic crisis and COVID 19 lockdowns. The decline in income and galloping inflation have led to a drastic decrease in purchasing power. The NGO’s emergency response is funded by the EU for a third year in a row. From October 2020 to April 2021, the NGOs achieved the following results 1,600 homes were rehabilitated , allowing people to live in safe and dignified conditions. Among a wide variety of shelter repairs, ramps were also installed for disabled beneficiaries. Throughout its intervention, ACTED ensured that beneficiaries were able to decide and choose themselves which rehabilitations were needed. 91 micro, small and medium businesses affected by the blast received emergency cash assistance to help them recover quickly. In addition to the blast, businesses also faced an unprecedented number of crises that pushed many to the brink of collapse. 987 at risk people were given psychological support . The explosion took a heavy toll on already mounting mental health issues. Many blast affected people relied on negative coping mechanisms and suffered deeper trauma. The consortium handled cases related to child protection and gender based violence, assisted isolated elderly and supported undocumented migrants. 2,645 individuals received legal advice on their rights as tenants in the blast affected areas in a context of increased tensions between landlords and tenants. Many people who are now unable to pay rent live in constant fear of eviction.",['Technological Disaster']
" Seventy seventh session Item 69 b of the provisional agenda Promotion and protection of human rights human rights questions, including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms Promotion and protection of human rights in the context of climate change Note by the Secretary General The Secretary General has the honour to transmit to the General Assembly the report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of climate change, Ian Fry, in accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 48 14 https documents dds ny.un.org doc UNDOC GEN G21 285 48 PDF G2128548.pdf?OpenElement . Summary We are faced with a global crisis in the name of climate change. Throughout the world, the rights of people are being negatively affected or violated as a consequence of climate change. The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of climate change highlights the reference to human rights included in the preamble to the Paris Agreement and considers the human rights implications of mitigation actions. Considerable attention is given to the extensive and disastrous lack of action to address loss and damage as a result of the impacts of climate change and its related human rights impacts. The Special Rapporteur also highlights the serious disconnect between those that continue to support the fossil fuel economy and those that are most affected by the impacts of climate change. Also highlighted is the fact that those most affected by climate change have the least participation and representation in political and decision making processes. The Special Rapporteur provides various recommendations on eliminating the use of fossil fuels, addressing the funding gap on loss and damage, improving participation and protecting the rights of indigenous and environmental human rights defenders. We are already confronted with a climate change emergency that comes with inherent serious human rights abuses. We can no longer delay. The time to actively address this emergency is now. I. Introduction 1. We are faced with a global crisis in the name of climate change. Throughout the world, human rights are being negatively affected and violated as a consequence of climate change. For many millions, climate change constitutes a serious threat to the ability of present and future generations to enjoy the right to life. Human induced climate change is the largest, most pervasive threat to the natural environment and human societies the world has ever experienced. In its article 28, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights guarantees that all human beings are entitled to a social and international order in which their rights and freedoms can be fully realized. Climate change already undermines this order and the rights and freedoms of all people. We are being confronted with an enormous climate change crisis of catastrophic proportions. It is happening now. 2. There is an enormous injustice being manifested by developed economies against the poorest and least able to cope. Unwillingness by developed economies and major corporations to take responsibility for drastically reducing their greenhouse gas emissions has led to demands for “climate reparations” for losses incurred. Some have suggested the term “atmospheric colonization” https phys.org news 2022 07 climate white colonization atmosphere tackle.html to explain the global imbalance between the impacts of climate change and the emitters of greenhouse gases. When ranked by income, the economically most privileged 50 per cent of countries are responsible for 86 per cent of the cumulative global carbon dioxide emissions, while the economically vulnerable half are responsible for only 14 per cent. 3. The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of climate change highlights the reference to human rights included in the preamble to the Paris Agreement, in which parties should, inter alia, “consider their respective obligations on human rights”. 4. The present report explores the functional arrangements of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. The report will focus primarily on three key themes mitigation emissions reduction , loss and damage the impacts of climate change and participation in decision making processes in the climate change regime. Underpinning all of these themes is the need for adequate and predictable finance and support. The implications for human rights will be considered in each of these three themes. The present report complements and updates the report https documents dds ny.un.org doc UNDOC GEN N19 216 42 PDF N1921642.pdf?OpenElement by the Special Rapporteur on the issue of human rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment. 5. To prepare the present report, throughout June and July 2022, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights in the context of climate change held extensive in person consultations in Bonn, Germany, as well as in Geneva and Lisbon, and numerous online consultations. In particular, he convened a number of meetings with civil society organizations, States that have signed the Geneva Pledge for Human Rights in Climate Action, members of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, small island developing States, and other stakeholders. These consultations complemented a call for inputs https www.ohchr.org en calls for input 2022 call input promotion and protection human rights context mitigation adaptation to which the Special Rapporteur received approximately 90 submissions.","['Drought', 'Flood', 'Heat Wave', 'Severe Local Storm', 'Tropical Cyclone']"
"More than 7.1 million people across 16 districts of Bihar are devastated by the floods. The Government reports records 23 deaths in Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, West Champaran, Saran and Samastipur. The situation is grim in the state as the water from the overflowing rivers originating from Nepal forced 4,95,336 people to evacuate their houses but only 11,793 people have taken refuge in the shelter camps. Most of the people have constructed makeshift tents at the upland embankments and waiting for the floodwater to recede. There is a definite gap between the number of people evacuated and the people residing in the relief camps, hinting at the preference of the people for open spaces and fear of COVID pandemic in the camps. At present only 06 Camps are functional, 05 in Samastipur and 1 in Khagaria. The District authorities have opened 1420 community kitchens in 7 districts to provide food support to the affected. “I was at home when flood water came from the northeast direction. It was noon, suddenly I heard a noise from people and my friend Jeevika didi, asked to evacuate as soon as possible as a heavy wave was supposed to enter the village. Before I could do something, the water rushed in up to my waist. Without wasting time, I took my goat on my back and took my children and a few of my utensils and reached the embankment”, shared Laxmi Devi from Bahadurpur village in Muzaffarpur. The need for emergency temporary shelter is looming as the community has put up tents on the embankments and National Highway 28 under the open sky. Panchayats covering the National Highways have supported the affected people with black polythene sheets to cover the roof but there are no official data available. “Today the confirmed cases in Bihar has reached to 70,000 and people are scared of the situation coupled with the flood. Apart from Water, Sanitation and Hygiene need people to require COVID protection kits like a mask, and sanitisers to prevent them from the virus. If the situation persists, people will need food support”, shared Abhishek Kumar, Caritas India State Officer of Bihar. Caritas India has planned its immediate and inclusive multi sectoral assistance to the socially excluded and most vulnerable communities in worst affected districts of Bihar. Initially, 1500 families of West Champaran and Muzaffarpur districts will be supported with temporary shelter and hygiene kits. Under the WaSH intervention, Caritas India is also planning for handpump chlorination minor repair to prevent the outbreak of waterborne infection along with WaSH awareness. Caritas India is accessing the situation and based on the development future action will be taken to support the affected community.","['Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Land Slide']"

" Highlights Karnataka has started releasing Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu The state govt decided to abide by SC directive on Tuesday Protesters have intensified the agitation in Mandya and other parts of the state BENGALURU Amid protests in several parts by farmers, Karnataka has started releasing Cauvery water to Tamil Nadu to abide by the Supreme court directive. The Karnataka government on Tuesday decided to release 15,000 cuses of water per day to Tamil Nadu for 10 days. After a three hour meeting with Union ministers from Karnataka, MPs and floor leaders of political parties in the legislature, chief minister Siddaramaiah told reporters As we cannot defy a constitutional body like the Supreme court, with a heavy heart we have decided to release the water as directed by the apex court. Meanwhile, the protesters have intensified their agitation in Mandya and other parts of the state blocking several roads and forcing schools and colleges to shut down. Simultaneously, the state government also intends to approach the Cauvery Supervisory Committee and try to convince them of their shortage in water levels and also file a petition in the court seeking modification of the directive of releasing 15,000 cusecs every day for 10 days. In 2012 13, when Jagadish Shettar was the CM, the state had released water up to 10,000 cusecs as a good will gesture. This time also, we had sought to release 10,000 cusecs of water but the court did not approve. We will try to impress upon the court to modify its order and reduce the water to be released to TN, considering the distress and severity of water shortage in the state, the CM said on Tuesday. The decision to file the modification appeal was taken after advice from former CM and Chikkaballapur MP Veerappa Moily. However, insiders in the government said Karnataka is not pinning its hope on the modification petition. According to one minister, the plan is to wait for the final hearing on the original petition filed by Karnataka, disputing the Cauvery Tribunal Authority verdict on the quantum of water to be released to TN. The final hearing is coming up on October 18. Further, the government is also pinning its hope on good rains to befall the state by the end of September.","['Drought', 'Heat Wave']"

"MANILA, December 7, 2020 – Thousands of families remain internally displaced temporarily staying in designated evacuation centers and makeshift shelters after Super Typhoon Rolly international name Goni battered the Bicol region, followed by Typhoon Ulysses international name Vamco which caused further devastation and massive flooding to the rest of Luzon including Rizal, Cagayan, Isabela, Metro Manila, and neighboring provinces. Rolly, considered the strongest typhoon to hit the country this year, destroyed more than 100,000 houses while Ulysses brought heavy rains causing dams to release water, submerging many low lying areas in Cagayan and Isabela. One month after the twin typhoons, child focused non profit agency World Vision in coordination with the local government units and other humanitarian agencies have initially assisted over 27,000 affected people wherein nearly half of these are children in the Albay, Catanduanes, Rizal, Cagayan and Isabela. “The needs of the families affected by two strong typhoons and the massive flooding in just a month are still significant. As most of the displaced families transition from evacuation centers to makeshift shelters, challenges still remain such as protection issues and lack of access to basic needs, shares World Vision National Director in the Philippines, Rommel Fuerte. As of December 04, 2020, a total of 6,427 affected families or 27,400 individuals received support in the form of hygiene kits, shelter kits, household non food items, food packs, and maternity kits. World Vision targets to complete its reach of 10,000 families in the next two months. World Vision also implements its extensive relief operations in Catanduanes and Albay with the help of United Nations Population Fund UNFPA , the Melissa Bill Gates Foundation and the European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations ECHO funded consortium project with OXFAM, ADRA, and PDRN. To widen the reach of the response, World Vision also tapped local partner community based organizations, Pangkaunlaran Development Association Inc., United Methodist Metro Santiago District and Green Meadow Development Foundation GMDF , to help the flood affected families in Northern Luzon. As the response transitions from relief to recovery phase, World Vision is focused on providing support in shelter and livelihood sectors with emphasis on cash based programming modalities. These include provision of shelter repair kits that include repair materials and carpentry tools and cash assistance for shelter repair. As a child focused organization, World Vision is concerned with the welfare of children especially those living in makeshift shelter where need for decent and livable space, protection and hygiene and sanitation in the midst of ongoing pandemic and continuing threat of natural hazard such as typhoon and heavy rains. In the education sector, Department of Education DepEd reported about 400,000 learning materials were damaged, adding difficulty for children to adapt and cope with the new normal learning approach. “We want the affected families and children to feel the essence of generosity and oneness especially that Christmas season is already here,” says Fuerte. “We thank our donors and sponsors who supported our efforts.

" Executive Summary As a cultural mosaic of over 80 diverse ethnic groups, interethnic tensions, power dynamics, and historical context are central to understanding all aspects of Ethiopia’s political, economic, and social affairs. Faulty democratic structures, declining legitimacy, persistent isomorphic mimicry, and a frail social contract are presently driving Ethiopia’s fragility. These structural flaws manifest most prominently across governance, security, and demographic clusters, rendering these the primary drivers of fragility. While flawed democracy, interethnic conflicts, and growing internal displacement are central to discussions of fragility in Ethiopia, the State’s inability to address ethnic and gendered inequalities, aid dependency, and low environmental resilience cannot be overlooked. Despite high hopes following the appointment of Prime Minister PM Abiy Ahmed in 2018, declining authority and capacity has created a vicious feedback cycle, undermining State legitimacy. Projecting to May 2021, scenarios consider political uncertainty related to the indefinite postponement of federal elections, authoritarian security enforcement, and intensifying interethnic conflicts, all against the backdrop of a displacement and climate induced humanitarian crisis. Recognizing strong Canada Ethiopia bilateral relations and significant investment in Ethiopian development, this policy brief is directed to Global Affairs Canada GAC . Building off of an evidence based analysis of Ethiopia’s fragility and informed projection of future trends, this brief provides several policy options as entry points for reducing fragility by supporting national peacebuilding strategies, deepening democratic governance, and promoting resilient agricultural development. GAC is well positioned to address a number of structural causes of Ethiopia’s fragility and support the country’s transition towards greater authority, capacity, legitimacy, and ultimately, State resilience.","['Drought', 'Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Insect Infestation']"

According to the National Emergency Commission more than 11,517 persons are in 178 shelters around the nation after having to leave their homes because of flooding and the risk of unstable ground giving way. More than a dozen main roads were closed, while others were only partially open. In the province of Guanacaste, which has been particularly hard hit by the heavy rains, many roads were impassable to all but four wheel drive vehicles and horses. A highway that connects the south of the country was washed away in Casa Mata. At least 5,000 residents fled to emergency shelters there, according to the Associated Press. As much of the Costa Rica returns to normal, many communities are still isolated, others without water, and destruction caused by rains continues to be tallied and dealt with. The National Emergency Commission CNE on October 9, updated the status of different parts of the country. Much of Guanacaste and Puntarenas, on the country’s Pacific side, remain under red alert, and others have returned to low or no alert as rains have returned to normal rainy season levels. The Costa Rican government declared a state of emergency, and President Luis Guillermo Solís appealed to the international community for support. The annual rainy season is currently underway in Central America a five month period typically ending in December in which the risk of flooding and mudslides are heightened. This year, some areas in the region, including Costa Rica, have gotten up to 50 percent more rain than average for the months of September and October. ACT Costa Rica Forum through it local member Lutheran Church of Costa Rica ILCO in coordination with implementing partners CSF and ACTUAR are planning to respond to this crisis by providing Shelter NFI s, Food security, WASH and Livelihoods. Over 1105 households and 5525 individuals will be benefited by this intervention. The ACT Costa Rica Forum is requesting 164,546.04 USD to run the activities.","['Flood', 'Severe Local Storm', 'Tropical Cyclone']"
" Weathering Risk’s Climate Risk Profile Jordan provides forward looking data on the climate in Jordan with the goal of supporting resilience oriented short to long term planning. The profile summarizes projected climate parameters and related sectoral impacts under two different emissions scenarios from now until 2080. The lived effects of climate change are becoming increasingly drastic in Jordan. Extreme weather events such as flash floods, associated landslides and recurring droughts have proliferated over the last decade. The Middle Eastern nation is already one of the most water stressed nations globally, and climate induced record low levels of rainfall, heightened evaporation and increases in temperature will further drive desertification, reduce water supply and exacerbate water scarcity in the future . This not only poses a substantial risk to the wellbeing and livelihood of the country’s population, but also adds additional pressure to existing tensions, for example around transboundary water sharing, particularly with Syria and Israel. Confronted with such direct threats to people’s livelihoods, trustworthy state of the art climate data is integral to enable stakeholders to conduct much needed long term planning and adaptation measures that promote resilience. Climate Risk Profile Jordan contributes to meeting this need. The climate models employed project that until 2080, under a medium to high emissions scenario, air temperatures will rise by up to 4.5°C , compared to pre industrial levels. Northwestern and central Jordan will experience a particularly significant increase of very hot days. The projected temperature changes will lead to increased exposure to heatwaves and pose a risk to the population’s ability to work and live. The climate models also include lower certainty projections for parameters including crop yields, GDP exposure to flooding and heatwaves, ecosystems impacts and water availability. Under the medium to high emissions scenario, annual per capita water availability will decline by around 75 compared to the year 2000, when water shortages were already alarming. These projected climate impacts will increase fragility risks associated with displacement and transboundary water sharing, and are likely to further undermine existing economic volatility, as well as local and regional stability. Reliable data can enhance capacity for action and improve operational responses towards a more climate resilient and peaceful future. When analysed alongside localised human security data, these projections can be used to inform comprehensive climate security risk assessments to support strategic and operational risk informed decision making and identify entry points for action. Such data can improve transboundary water cooperation, and inform peace agreements on the ground. The recent water energy agreement https www.reuters.com business energy israel jordan partner water for energy deal israeli ministry says 2021 11 22 between Jordan, the UAE and Israel signed at COP27 highlights the pressing need to address water and energy security to promote stability in the region.

"Thursday September 22, 2022 The new food security analysis from Somalia must be the final wake up call to the international community to act now and stop Somalia falling into famine. Hundreds of thousands of lives are at risk unless more aid urgently reaches people on the ground, Islamic Relief is warning. With the analysis showing that people are already starving and that famine is likely to be just weeks away in some parts of the country, waiting until a formal famine declaration would be a shameful delay. More than 260,000 people died in the 2011 famine in the region, and about half of them had already died by the time the crisis was officially declared a famine. Four consecutive failed rainy seasons the region's worst drought in 40 years has wiped out crops and cattle and forced more than 1 million Somalis from their homes in a desperate search for food and water. 66 of those fleeing are children. Yet the international response has been, and still is, far too slow. The next rainy season is also predicted to be poor. Waseem Ahmad, CEO of Islamic Relief Worldwide, says There is a clear choice act now to get more aid on the ground and save lives, or many people will die. Today's stark figures must galvanise donors into action. Without an urgent scale up of aid, hundreds of thousands of lives are at risk. The world must not wait for famine to be declared, we must do everything we can to prevent it. Aid workers and families in Somalia already know that people are starving, with children and the elderly facing particularly acute pain and suffering. In just one camp in Baidoa people say that more than 300 children have died in the last three months. Islamic Relief aid workers have met families walking for days in scorching heat to reach the camps in the hope of receiving life saving aid yet when they arrive there is simply not enough food to go round and diseases are rife. Children and elderly people have died from hunger and thirst on the journey, while women and girls are at risk of attack while walking miles alone. Right now we are seeing unprecedented climate related disasters all over the world. From the worst floods in living memory in Pakistan to the worst drought in decades in Somalia, it is often the people who contribute least to climate change who suffer the gravest consequences. We need real global commitment to tackle the climate crisis and we need it urgently. In Somalia, local, national and international humanitarian organisations can and are reaching communities most in need and evidence clearly shows that when livelihoods and livestock are protected people are much less likely to fall into famine's deadly shadow. Islamic Relief is on the ground in Somalia and in other drought affected parts of the Horn of Africa and is providing lifesaving food, water, cash and healthcare. So far Islamic Relief has helped more than 167,000 people in the region but is struggling to raise enough funds to scale up the response further as the crisis has received little attention. Islamic Relief is calling for an immediate increase in humanitarian aid to save lives now. The international community must also support communities to cope with the long term consequences of the drought on people's livelihoods and way of life and strengthen communities' resilience in the face of climate change.

" I. Introduction 1 . The present report is submitted pursuant to Security Council resolution 2514 2020 https undocs.org en S RES 2514 2020 , by which the Council extended the mandate of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan UNMISS until 15 March 2021 and requested me to report to the Council on the implementation of the Mission’s mandate every 90 days. It covers political and security developments between 1 June and 31 August 2020, the humanitarian and human rights situation and progress made in the implementation of the Mission’s mandate. II. Political and economic developments 2 . On 17 June, the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, and the First VicePresident, Riek Machar, reached a decision on responsibility sharing ratios for gubernatorial and State positions, ending a three month impasse on the allocations of States. Central Equatoria, Eastern Equatoria, Lakes, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Warrap and Unity were allocated to the incumbent Transitional Government of National Unity Upper Nile, Western Bahr el Ghazal and Western Equatoria were allocated to the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement Army in Opposition SPLM A IO and Jonglei was allocated to the South Sudan Opposition Alliance. The Other Political Parties coalition was not allocated a State, as envisioned in the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan, in which the coalition had been guaranteed 8 per cent of the positions. 3 . On 29 June, the President appointed governors of 8 of the 10 States and chief administrators of the administrative areas of Abyei, Ruweng and Pibor. On 17 July, the governor of Jonglei was appointed, a decision objected to by the National Democratic Movement a member of the South Sudan Opposition Alliance , which argued that it had further prevented it from participating in the Revitalized Transitional Government of National Unity because its nominee had not been considered. The Upper Nile governor position remains vacant owing to disagreement over the nomination of Lieutenant General Johnson Olony, whom the President refused to appoint. 4 . Although the Revitalized Agreement requires 35 per cent participation of women in all institutions of governance, only one woman nominated by SPLM A IO was appointed as governor. On 2 July, women leaders issued a communiqué addressed to the President, calling on the parties to adhere to the 35 per cent quota. 5 . On 10 August, a high level committee on the formation of State and local governments reported that the parties had agreed on 10 State governors, one of whom was a woman, and their deputies, 10 speakers of State assemblies and their deputies and 79 county commissioner positions. They also agreed on 35 county councils, 17 ministers, 51 members of State assemblies, 5 State advisers, 6 chairpersons, 6 commission deputies and 8 specialized committees in each State. The responsibility for nominating mayors, their deputies and secretaries general was entrusted to the governors. 6 . As a result of the coronavirus disease COVID 19 pandemic, political activity remained limited. The First Vice President and the Vice President, James Wani Igga, along with other cabinet members who had previously tested positive for COVID 19, resumed their duties. The resumption of duties did not, however, translate into full normalcy in government operations because pandemic related restrictions prevented sustained engagement among parties, stakeholders and mediators. While efforts were undertaken to employ online modes of interaction, technical and organizational challenges hindered those initiatives.","['Drought', 'Epidemic', 'Flood', 'Other']"
"The United States, through the U.S. Agency for International Development USAID , is providing 1 million in immediate humanitarian assistance to support the people affected by unprecedented flooding in Nigeria. The unusually heavy rainfall and resulting flooding has affected nearly 2.8 million people across the country. In addition, tens of thousands of homes have been damaged or completely destroyed, forcing the displacement of two million people. More than 600 people have died. The floods have exacerbated an already critical humanitarian situation in Nigeria, where ongoing conflict, especially in the northern region, has already driven millions of people from their homes. In the same region, more than four million people are projected to continue experiencing acute food insecurity amid the worsening global food crisis. To make matters worse, we are concerned that standing floodwaters could also increase the risk of cholera and other waterborne diseases in Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe states, where cholera outbreaks were declared in August and September and at least 7,750 cases were recorded. In 2022, 31 out of 35 states reported cholera cases. Today’s 1 million in new USAID support will allow local partners on the ground to provide emergency shelter repair kits and hygiene kits to promote safe and healthy practices amid the ongoing cholera outbreak, and multipurpose cash assistance for people impacted by the devastating floods. As experts expect heavy rainfall to continue through November, USAID disaster experts will continue monitoring the situation in close coordination with humanitarian partners, the Government of Nigeria, and the U.S. Embassy in Abuja to assess needs and determine additional assistance needed. The United States will continue standing with the people of Nigeria during this extremely difficult time and maintains a long history of providing humanitarian assistance across the country. In fiscal year 2022 alone, USAID provided more than 356 million in lifesaving, multi sector assistance to people most affected by conflict and food insecurity.","['Epidemic', 'Flash Flood', 'Flood']"

Although there has been a Palestinian village in the area since the nineteenth century, the Israeli military displaced the residents from the original site of the village, declaring it an archeological site, and does not allow construction whatsoever in the present location. The military has issued demolition orders even for tents and temporary structures Palestinians built there. In the face of the raging winter storm, this injustice is more blatant than ever.

" HIGHLIGHTS In May, WFP delivers emergency food assistance to an estimated 11.3 million people—the highest number of beneficiaries reached in a single month WFP regains access to wheat flour stored at the Red Sea Mills facility near Al Hudaydah city May–June flooding across Yemen affects 80,000 people KEY DEVELOPMENTS On June 22, the UN World Food Program WFP activated a partial suspension of emergency food assistance in Yemen’s capital city of Sana’a. The suspension, which remains in place as of July 12, follows extended discussion and a lack of agreement with Al Houthi officials on the introduction of controls to prevent the diversion of food assistance. The partial suspension of general food distributions, which affects approximately 850,000 food insecure people in Sana’a city, does not include WFP’s ongoing nutrition activities. High level negotiations between WFP and Al Houthi officials on independent beneficiary identification and the implementation of a biometric beneficiary registration system continue. From January 1–July 5, health actors recorded nearly 462,000 suspected cholera cases, surpassing the approximately 371,000 suspected cases recorded in all of 2018, according to the UN World Health Organization WHO . Lack of safe drinking water and adequate sanitation and hygiene services throughout Yemen are driving the high numbers of suspected cases. Additionally, flooding across much of the country in May and June may have accelerated the disease’s spread following a temporary decrease in the number of suspected cases recorded in May. The U.S. Government USG continues to support partners to provide water, sanitation, and hygiene WASH and health care services throughout Yemen to prevent and track the further spread of cholera and provide care to affected populations.","['Epidemic', 'Flash Flood']"
" When Abuk took her baby to the Save the Children supported clinic in Abyei, Akel was found to be severely malnourished. She has since received life saving treatment and is now stable and recovering. Abyei, South Sudan Conflict, floods and drought in South Sudan has exposed many families especially women and children to poverty. Abuk, 38, from South Sudan has nothing to feed her three children as there is no food in the area where she lives. In 2019. Abuk 38, could not harvest her sorghum, groundnut and simsim because of the drought, and in 2020 floods also destroyed Abuk’s crops. Abuk has lived for three years without the help of her husband who is a soldier and rarely stays with the family. Both Abuk and her husband have little income to support the family. Abuk gathers firewood and poles so she can sell them to buy food for her children and sometimes she washes dishes at local restaurants just to make ends meet. Most of the time the money Abuk earns is not enough to buy food to feed her children and they go hungry sometimes the whole day without food. Abuk’s health and her youngest daughter Akel, who is only eight months old, started to deteriorate because they don’t feed enough. They lost weight. Because Abuk didn’t have enough to eat, her body could not generate enough breast milk to feed her daughter. There were no proper health facilities to treat Abuk’s daughter, Akel, where they live so Abuk has to walk for sixty kilometers 15 hours on foot to search for a healthy facility. At the time they reached Save the Children health centre, their last meal was three days ago. “I am here because of my baby she has been sick for long period of time”, Abuk says. “This forced me to leave my village to seek further treatment and I hope my child’s condition will improve, she explains to a Save the Children Health official. Abuk says, she is living with the “mercy of Good Samaritans” who continue to support her with some food items. Abuk says, she is upset because she left nothing back home and currently having nothing on her way to search for health facility in Abyei. “I hope my child will get better medication so that I can start fresh life here, or go back to my home land”, Abuk says. When Abuk took her baby to the Save the Children supported clinic in Abyei, Akel was found to be severely malnourished. She has since received life saving treatment and is now stable and recovering. Save the Children is doing community intervention looking at the long term improvement of the malnutrition rate in the Abyei. With support from ECHO, Save the Children is strengthening the capacity of the local authorities, the local community and the local government at the Ministry of Health in terms of behavior change on how people can manage their nutrition status without the intervention of humanitarian organizations. We also have MYCN. There is also community mobilization and community awareness to ensure that at least people get the basic knowledge on how to prevent malnutrition, how to eat balanced died using the available resources in the area and where to refer in case there is complication of malnutrition. Save the Children helps children survive in the face of some of the most adverse conditions in the world. Our focus is maternal, new born and child survival and we provide drugs, equipment, training and other support to government health centres, deliver vaccinations, and provide care to children who are malnourished.","['Drought', 'Flood', 'Other']"

" UN unveils ambitious target to adapt to climate change and more extreme weather Within the next five years, everyone on Earth should be protected by early warning systems against increasingly extreme weather and climate change, according to an ambitious new United Nations target announced today. UN Secretary General António Guterres has tasked the World Meteorological Organization WMO to lead the effort and present an action plan to achieve this goal at the next UN climate conference in Egypt this November. The announcement was made on World Meteorological Day on 23 March, which this year has the theme Early Warning and Early Action https public.wmo.int en resources world meteorological day world meteorological day 2022 early warning early action . “Human caused climate disruption is now damaging every region. The most recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change details the suffering already happening. Each increment of global heating will further increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events,” said Mr Guterres. “We must invest equally in adaptation and resilience. That includes the information that allows us to anticipate storms, heatwaves, floods and droughts,” said the UN chief. However, one third of the world’s people, mainly in least developed countries and small island developing states, are still not covered by early warning systems. In Africa, it is even worse 60 per cent of people lack coverage. “This is unacceptable, particularly with climate impacts sure to get even worse,” said Mr Guterres. “Early warnings and action save lives. To that end, today I announce the United Nations will spearhead new action to ensure every person on Earth is protected by early warning systems within five years. I have asked the World Meteorological Organization to lead this effort and to present an action plan at the next UN climate conference, later this year in Egypt,” Mr Guterres said in a video message to the World Meteorological Day ceremony https public.wmo.int en resources world meteorological day world meteorological day 2022 early warning early action programme . “We must boost the power of prediction for everyone and build their capacity to act. On this World Meteorological Day, let us recognize the value of early warnings and early action as critical tools to reduce disaster risk and support climate adaptation.” Climate change is already very visible through more extreme weather in all parts of the world. We are seeing more intense heatwaves and drought and forest fires. There is more water vapor in the atmosphere, which leads to extreme rainfall and deadly flooding. The warming of the ocean fuels more powerful tropical storms and rising sea levels increase the impacts. Over the past 50 years 1970 2019 , a weather, climate or water related disaster has occurred on average every day – taking the lives 115 people and causing US 202 million in losses daily, according to a 2021 WMO report on disaster statistics https library.wmo.int index.php?lvl notice display id 21930 .YjRNhBDP00o . The number of recorded disasters increased by a factor of five over that 50 year period, driven by human induced climate change, more extreme weather events and improved reporting. Thanks to better warnings, the number of lives lost decreased almost three fold over the same period because of better weather forecasts and proactive and coordinated disaster management. “The growing number of disasters due to climate change is endangering implementation of a large number of Sustainable Development Goals. Besides very critical mitigation it is growingly important to invest in climate adaptation. One of the highest returns of investments is reached by improving the weather, water and climate early warning services and related observing infrastructures. There is a need to invest US 1.5 billion during the coming five years to improve the quality of the services and related infrastructures especially in the LDC and SIDS countries,” said WMO Secretary General Prof. Petteri Taalas. What is an Early Warning System? An Early Warning System for floods, droughts, heatwaves or storms, is an integrated system which allows people to know that hazardous weather is on its way, and informs how governments, communities and individuals can act to minimize the impending impacts. These systems allow us to monitor the real time atmospheric conditions on land and at sea and to effectively predict future weather and climate events using advanced computer numerical models. The aim is to understand what risks the foreseeable storms could bring to an area that will be affected – which may differ if it is a city or rural area, polar, coastal or mountainous regions. Early warning systems must include agreed response plans for governments, communities and people, to minimize anticipated impacts. A comprehensive early warning system must also include lessons learned from past events, in order to continually improve responses ahead of future weather, climate, water and related environmental hazards. Early Warnings Work The 2019 Global Commission on Adaptation flagship report ‘Adapt Now’ found that Early Warning Systems provide more than a tenfold return on investment – the greatest of any adaptation measure included in the report. The report also found that just 24 hours warning of a coming storm or heatwave can cut the ensuing damage by 30 per cent and spending US 800 million on such systems in developing countries would avoid losses of 3 16 billion per year. And yet, despite these known great benefits, one in three people globally is still not covered by early warning services, and the proportion of people not covered is almost twice as high in Africa. Vulnerable people are disproportionately affected. The Glasgow Climate Pact agreed at the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in November 2021 emphasizes the urgency of scaling up action to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change. It also urges developed countries to urgently and significantly scale up their provision of climate finance, technology transfer and capacity building for adaptation. The UK government, which was president of COP26, and the Egyptian government, which will preside over COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh, recently renewed calls on developed countries to follow through on their commitment to at least double their climate finance for adaptation to developing countries by 2025, aiming at achieving balance between funding adaptation and mitigation. Ambassadors of both the UK and Egypt are due to speak at the World Meteorological Day ceremony https public.wmo.int en resources world meteorological day world E2 89 88 meteorological day 2022 early warning early action text World 20Meteorological 20Day 2023 20March,Information 20for 20Disaster 20Risk 20Reduction. , which included high level panels of speakers illustrating the need for, and success of, early warnings and early action. Synergies and Partnerships WMO will spearhead the effort to achieve universal coverage of early warning services, in close collaboration with key partners as a collective contribution towards global adaptation efforts. It will seek to close observation gaps, to expand the capacity for all countries to issue warnings ahead of a disaster, and simultaneously improve their capacity to act on those warnings, and to respond in a manner that is people centred, inclusive and accessible. Following on from Mr Guterres’ announcement, WMO will convene key agencies, countries and groups already active in the field of Hydromet and Risk Informed Early Warning capacity development to build on the excellent existing efforts and create a global plan by COP27. Closing the early warning gap will require inputs from actors throughout the entire early warning to early action value chain. The new plan seeks to build on existing WMO activities and partnerships. These include The WMO Global Multi hazard Alert System GMAS https community.wmo.int activity areas drr gmas leverages progress in early warnings against hazards such as tropical cyclones, flooding and coastal inundation. The Systematic Observations Financing Facility SOFF https alliancehydromet.org systematic observations financing facility , which was established at COP26 jointly with UNEP and UNDP as a new financing mechanism https public.wmo.int en media press release un unveils new finance mechanism boost climate action . It seeks to significantly increase the availability of basic weather and climate observations data and close the gaps, especially in the Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States. This data is the basis of all weather forecast and climate services and so these gaps undermine the effectiveness of all climate adaptations actions and investments. The Nordic Development Fund NDF recently committed 10 million Euros to SOFF. The Climate Risk and Early Warning Systems Initiative CREWS https public.wmo.int en climate risk and early warning systems crews bridges the capacity gap in life saving early warning systems for vulnerable countries. The initiative ensures that prediction and warnings of extreme events are received, understood and acted on by people most at risk.

In 2022, WMO is scaling up its action on early warning systems in Africa through CREWS with a new US 5 million early warning programme for the Central Africa region.

After tripling the size of its workforce, Merlin scaled up its work in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and expanded into Sindh and Punjab provinces, taking health care to around two and a half million people, many in inaccessible, remote locations. “People are in dire need” Now, as this year’s rains claim hundreds of lives and threaten the health and livelihoods of millions more, Merlin has expanded its emergency response to help communities in the deluged district of Badin in Sindh, Pakistan’s worst affected province. Marco Aviotti, Merlin’s Country Director in Pakistan, has said that “Many of the people we are providing health services to are in dire need, having lost homes, livelihoods and loved ones in last year’s floods. “Merlin’s teams in Pakistan are committed to helping people and have, once again, reacted quickly to reach communities in the most remote areas.” Merlin has despatched five mobile health teams to areas where the waters have destroyed infrastructure, making roads to existing clinics virtually impassable. We have also launched 10 additional mobile health teams in Badin, in addition to the 25 static facilities and 8 mobile teams we have been supporting in Sindh since the 2010 floods. All our work in Pakistan is made possible by your generous donations, so do please keep supporting Merlin's essential and life saving work in that region and around the world.","['Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Mud Slide']"
" b appeal no. 13 99 br situation report no. 3 br period covered 21 June 10 August 1999 b br i The massive relief effort, which mitigated the worst effects of the cyclone, is almost over. To help the most seriously affected through the difficult period preceding the November harvest, the Pakistan Red Crescent is supplying them with food packs, domestic kits and hut construction materials and making medicines available for the next three months to its mobile medical teams. i p The context p The cyclone that struck the south east coast of Pakistan, in the vicinity of the Indus delta, on 20 May caused massive destruction to housing in the coastal towns and villages of the two districts of Badin and Thatta in Sindh province, and to agriculture and the fishing industry. At least 600,000 people in 5,200 villages were affected and 191 people, mostly fishermen, were killed. Several hundred persons remain missing and are presumed dead. Over 75,000 houses were destroyed and some 59,000 damaged. 400,000 acres of agricultural land were inundated with salt water and 28,000 head of livestock perished. 675 fishing boats were destroyed. Much of the infrastructure of the two districts roads, communications systems and electrical lines was damaged. p Latest events p Through a major effort by the Pakistan government, the armed services and the Pakistan Red Crescent PRCS in association with the Federation, the situation in the disaster area has improved, and in some villages is returning to normal. Roads have been rebuilt, electricity restored and canals dredged. Building material has been supplied, food provided and the essentials of life given to many of the affected families. The government has made cash settlements to those families who can confirm loss of a family member or whose home was destroyed or damaged. This assistance by the government, the armed services, PRCS Federation and local NGOs has made a major difference in restoring normality in the disaster area. At this time, most of the other agencies have scaled back or ceased their relief efforts entirely. p Some people have nevertheless slipped through the social safety net provided. These are generally people living on single family plots of land away from villages or towns. The further away from the main transportation routes victims are located, the less likely they will be to have received adequate assistance. Some 400 families are still without permanent shelter as they have not received compensation from the government due to their family members still being considered quot missing quot . p Another approximately 5,000 families in the two districts affected are still forced to rely on borrowed or inadequate domestic utensils. p Many of the people in the disaster area are suffering from medical problems derived from the unsafe drinking water and from the dust. Dysentery, diarrhoea, skin infections and eye irritations are widespread. As the monsoon season has started, malaria is becoming a serious problem. p Although there are no critical food shortages, many people lack the resources to purchase food as a result of losing their crops or fishing boats. Assistance is required to help tide these people over until the next harvest, expected in November. p Red Cross Red Crescent action p b Initial Action b p The PRCS Federation was among the first to respond to the cyclone. Donations of food and clothing were immediately delivered to the disaster area, often by helicopter or boat. Approximately 6,000 food parcels and 1,000 domestic kits were distributed in this manner. The extensive need of medical attention was quickly identified and the PRCS organised a series of mobile clinics in response doctors, other medical staff and medicines were taken directly into the villages. This work is still ongoing and constitutes a real success story for the PRCS. p b Identification of Beneficiaries b p Parallel to its relief activities, the PRCS has spent the last month identifying families most in need of assistance through an extensive family survey. Nearly 7,000 families have been interviewed to determine their present needs and their resources prior to the cyclone. Specifically, this aimed at identifying the 400 families who will receive shelters and shelter materials. In addition, approximately 5,000 families were identified to receive further supplies of domestic utensils and food. p b Tendering and Distribution b p Contracts have been signed to purchase the final supply of goods needed for the above beneficiaries. Tendering is under way for the 13 items of the domestic kits , total value CHF 111,964. 850 Domestic Kits at a cost of CHF 24,973 have already been purchased and distributed. p Purchasing of 14,452 Food Packs each sufficient for one family for one week and containing wheat flour, rice, sugar, dal channa, salt and cooking oil, for a total value of CHF 100,726, has begun. 1550 Food Packs at a cost of 20,757 CHF have already been purchased and distributed. Hut construction material, sufficient for 400 huts, value CHF 90,909, and sufficient medicines for one mobile clinic per day for three months, value CHF 102,885, is also in progress. Twenty seven mobile medical clinics have been conducted at a cost of 21,212 CHF. p The per unit costs vary between what already has been purchased and what is presently being tendered, largely due to the comprehensive tendering process which has brought the prices down to a very competitive level. In addition, the content of the domestic, food and medicine purchases have varied, in order to reflect the updated and changing needs. The final distribution of domestic kits will be tailored to the specific needs of separate villages and, if necessary, to specific households. p b Distribution b p Distribution of these goods is taking place throughout August. By the end of the month, all earmarked and time constrained donated money will have been spent and the goods distributed. p Outstanding needs p It is expected that when the present goods have been distributed, 100 of shelter needs in the area will have been met. Additionally, the most needy will have received an additional three weeks of food along with basic domestic items. The food requirement will continue until the harvest in November, but sufficient food stocks exist from other sources so that, although food may be in short supply, there is no danger of starvation. It is expected that the medical needs of the Thatta and Badin people will continue after this appeal is completed. Any further requirements will be identified by the PRCS, and as far as possible, included in its other medical programmes. p b Emergency Preparedness b p The capability of the PRCS to respond to natural disasters and other calamities needs to be augmented. In the immediate aftermath of the cyclone, most of the tents and domestic goods despatched to the disaster area were sent from Islamabad. Some of these items were not immediately needed and were held in storage in Sindh province. In the meantime, the national society had ordered replenishments for its stocks, amounting to CHF 19,745 for tents and CHF 2,663 for kerosene stoves. Any original items which were not distributed, including small quantities of tents and kerosene stoves, will be added to the national contingency stocks for emergency use. No earmarked funds were used for this purpose. A small contribution to building the local disaster preparedness capacity and experience is also foreseen at the end of this programme, but again no earmarked or time constrained items will be used for this purpose. p Contributions p See annex 1 for details p Conclusion p The immediate action of the Pakistan government, the army, NGOs and PRCS had a significant impact on meeting the initial needs of the most vulnerable. The distributions now being undertaken by the PRCS will help to bridge the gap in coverage between the end of significant emergency assistance and the November harvest. p Peter Rees Gildea br Director, br Operations Funding and Reporting Department p Hiroshi Higashiura br Director, br Asia amp Pacific Department.",['Extratropical Cyclone']

Provide life saving assistance and protection to people affected by the storms and flooding and re establish access to basic services. ii. Provide multi sector assistance to the most vulnerable groups, including displace people, vulnerable children and other groups iii. Support the restoration of livelihoods and self reliance. iv. Deliver assistance in a manner that mitigates the risk of COVID19 for disaster affected people. SITUATION OVERVIEW Since the beginning of October, Cambodia has been experiencing heavy rainfall as a result of multiple tropical storms that have crossed into Cambodia after making landfall in Viet Nam that has led to widespread flooding across 19 provinces. As of 28 October, 42 people are known to have died. According to data from the Government, more than 2 million people have been exposed to flooding and some 800,000 people have been directly affected. Of these, an estimated 388,000 people with pre existing vulnerabilities households classified as IDPoor prior to the disaster and are in need of humanitarian assistance calculated through geospatial analysis of the satellite based flood extent layer with the location of each IDPoor household . According to the Provincial Committees for Disaster Management, the most severely affected provinces are Battambang, Banteay Meanchey, Pursat, Kompong Speu and Kampong Thom in central and western Cambodia. As a result of the succession of storms and subsequent flooding, more than 161,500 houses have been damaged. Because of damage to their houses, some 14,300 households were evacuated to safe sites, evacuation centres or in some cases in informal sites where they are sheltering in tents or under plastic sheeting. The Royal Government of Cambodia has provided an immediate food assistance response including the provision of 1200MT of rice to flood affected households and planned livelihoods recovery support. Other immediate responders included the Cambodian Red Cross as well as UN and NGO partners. Despite this first line response, there remain gaps in the ability of poor affected households to meet essential food and nutrition, shelter, water and sanitation, health and other needs for the most vulnerable 53,000 households. Between 19 and 21 October, a Joint Government UNNGO assessment was conducted in six flood affected provinces Battambang, Banteay, Meanchey, Pursat, Pailin, Phnom Penh and Kandal. According to the findings of the Joint Assessment, key needs include access to clean water, sanitation facilities and hygiene items, food especially for children under five, essential items for those whose houses have been damaged or destroyed including mosquito nets, blankets and tarpaulins, access to education supplies and temporary learning spaces, and assistance to restart livelihood activities. As a result of the storms and floods, over 175,000 households have had their livelihoods impacted and 329,000 hectares of agricultural land has been damaged. Food and nutrition needs have been assessed as critical with 89,152 of the most vulnerable households across 14 provinces requiring food assistance and livelihoods recovery support. Key infrastructure including roads and bridges have also been damaged, hampering the delivery of assistance. Access to health as been disrupted with 66 health care facilities and six hospitals have affected although only one has been seriously damaged requiring evacuation of patients and relocation of medical equipment. In addition, 950 recently reopened schools have been affected by the floods, with at least six schools being used as temporary evacuation shelters. Other damage to facilities has concerns about protection of vulnerable populations, with the welfare of 1,640 children in 48 residential care institutions and the population of two prisons who have been moved to other prisons and where there is now overcrowding being of urgent concern. Cambodia is one of most heavily contaminated countries in the world, with landmines, cluster munitions and other unexploded weapons affecting the country. The floods have raised the possibility that unexploded ordnance and landmines will have become dislodged while their safe removal is being hampered due to the inaccessibility of some areas, increasing the risk of landmine and UXO incidents. Five requests for UXO removal have already been responded to so far. The COVID 19 outbreak is well controlled in Cambodia. As 02 November, Cambodia has not reported any community transmission cases of COVID 19 since April. However, the situation remains dynamic and the possibility of an introduction of COVID 19 cannot be ignored. In the context of the ongoing disaster, with the local health care system damaged, and local authorities and affected population focused on the flood response, maintaining prevention measures to COVID 19 must also be prioritised. COVID 19 is also compounding existing vulnerabilities which will be further increased as a result of the current flooding. Despite the rapid response from the Government and partners, due to the scale of the disaster, further support is needed to scale up the response, including immediate humanitarian assistance as well as longer term support to restore access to basic services and rebuild the livelihoods of affected people. The Cambodia Flood Response Plan 2020 aims to target the needs of approximately 237,000 flood affected people over the period of 6 months. It has been developed by the Humanitarian Response Forum and Sectors in Cambodia in consultation with the Resident Coordinator and the Government. It aims to identify those critical response priorities to be covered by UN agencies, NGOs and the Red Cross in order to augment the wider Government response. The Response Plan will consider both the immediate humanitarian needs and early recovery activities, which are integrated through all Sector plans. Sectors involved in the plan have worked in close coordination with each other to ensure that priority activities in this plan have the most significant impact on the lives of the most vulnerable people. The Humanitarian Response Forum released six flood situation reports between 12 26 October.

" I. Introduction 1. The present report is submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 68 11 and Security Council resolution 2489 2019 , in which the Secretary General was requested to report every three months on developments in Afghanistan. 2. The report provides an update on the activities of the United Nations in Afghanistan, including political, humanitarian, development and human rights efforts, since the issuance of the previous report dated 17 June 2020 A 74 897 S 2020 549 . The annex to the present report contains an assessment of progress made towards the achievement of benchmarks and indicators since the issuance of the report of 28 February 2019 A 73 777 S 2019 193 , in accordance with Security Council resolution 1868 2009 . II. Relevant developments 3. The implementation of the political agreement concluded on 17 May between the President, Ashraf Ghani, and the Chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, Abdullah Abdullah, encountered hurdles over the appointment of ministers, provincial governors and other positions, delaying the formation of the Cabinet. The continued release of prisoners and the observation of two ceasefires over Eid al Fitr and Eid al Adha gave momentum to intra Afghan negotiations, but attacks continued. The United States of America announced that it had reduced forces from 13,000 to 8,600, in keeping with the Joint Declaration between the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and the United States of America for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan and the Agreement for Bringing Peace to Afghanistan between the United States of America and the Taliban, both signed on 29 February. The Government continued efforts to promote regional consensus on intra Afghan peace and reconciliation, economic cooperation and connectivity, and the response to coronavirus disease COVID 19 . The spread of COVID 19, compounded by violence, natural disasters and food insecurity, added to the surge in humanitarian needs, with some 14 million people estimated to be in need of humanitarian assistance in 2020. Planning continued for the 2020 ministerial conference on Afghanistan.","['Drought', 'Epidemic']"
" Desert locust populations in Kenya have declined due to recent control operations and onward migrations toward Ethiopia and Sudan. FAO anticipates that Ethiopia will remain an epicenter of the regional desert locust upsurge through October unless intensive control operations are launched. Response teams continue to conduct locust control activities in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia but report that surveillance capacity in Ethiopia requires further strengthening. The threat of locust invasions into West Africa from Sudan has subsided. KEY DEVELOPMENTS Operations Continue Against Locusts in Kenya and Somalia Response teams continue to control bands of hoppers—immature, wingless locusts—and immature swarms in northwestern Kenya, contributing to a significant decline in desert locust populations in recent weeks, FAO reports. Most swarms are now concentrated in the region’s Turkana County, where aerial and ground operations are ongoing. Northward migrations to Ethiopia and Sudan—via South Sudan and possibly northeastern Uganda—have begun however, FAO expects the overall scale of desert locust migrations from Kenya to be smaller than previously anticipated due to the success of recent control efforts. Meanwhile, aerial and ground teams in Somalia have launched control interventions against immature swarms detected on the northern plateau between Nugal Region’s Garoowe city and Woqooyi Galbeed Region’s Hargeysa city, where some breeding is underway the situation in the south—where access constraints are hindering surveillance—remains unclear. Swarms in northern Somalia continue to migrate eastward and could travel across the Indian Ocean to India and Pakistan unless adequately controlled. FAO notes that the threat to Southwest Asia is expected to decrease as rains produce favorable breeding conditions in northern Somalia in the coming weeks. Internet Services Suspension, Insecurity Hinder Surveillance in Ethiopia Control operations against immature swarms in Ethiopia’s northern Rift Valley and eastern Harar Highlands are ongoing, with response teams also receiving reports of locust presence in Afar, Amhara, Tigray, and Somali regions in recent weeks, according to FAO. However, a countrywide suspension of internet and telecommunications services—imposed by the Government of Ethiopia in response to civil unrest in the capital city of Addis Ababa and Oromiya Region—may have hindered locust surveillance for three weeks during July, preventing timely reporting on the locust situation and challenging efforts to launch targeted pest control interventions. FAO and the Famine Early Warning Systems Network FEWS NET project that infestations could persist across Ethiopia through January 2021, with the country serving as an epicenter of the regional upsurge through at least October due to favorable breeding conditions in eastern, northern, and western Ethiopia, as well as declining desert locust populations in Kenya and Somalia. In recent weeks, immature swarms from Kenya have migrated northwards into Ethiopia and joined existing swarms, traveling to the country’s northern highlands or onward to northwestern Somalia. Two swarms from Yemen—another epicenter for summer infestations—had also arrived in northeastern Ethiopia as of early August FAO expects further invasions from Kenya and Yemen to amplify locust breeding in Ethiopia in the coming weeks. While FEWS NET anticipates regenerative rainfall will offset any locust related damage to pastureland in most affected areas of northern and western Ethiopia in the coming months, localized pasture losses are likely in some conflict affected areas of the two regions, where insecurity is restricting surveillance and control efforts. In the absence of large scale aerial and ground control campaigns, desert locust infestations—coupled with projected below average rainfall—will likely result in significant crop and pasture losses from October to December. Threat of Invasions Into West Africa Subsides as Rains Continue in Sudan The risk of onward migrations from Sudan into West Africa’s Sahel region has subsided due to seasonal rainfall in Sudan’s White Nile State and Darfur and Kordofan regions, which has produced suitable conditions for locust breeding and development in recent weeks. As such, FAO expects swarms from Kenya to rapidly mature and lay eggs upon arrival in Sudan, reducing the likelihood of locusts invading eastern Chad and traveling further west across the Sahel in search of favorable conditions for breeding and development. Government of Sudan Plant Protection Directorate PPD teams continue to survey at risk areas in Sudan, including areas located near the Sudan–South Sudan border. Although a few swarms are expected to arrive in Sudan in the coming weeks, PPD teams had not detected any invasions from Kenya as of August 7. Locusts and Below Average Rains to Impact Crops and Livestock in Somalia In recent months, the socioeconomic impact of coronavirus disease COVID 19 mitigation measures, erratic rainfall, and desert locust infestations have exacerbated food insecurity across Somalia, particularly in central pastoral areas, where low livestock holdings, the threat of expanding locust infestations, and limited access to humanitarian assistance are driving Crisis—IPC 3—levels of acute food insecurity, according to FEWS NET. Meanwhile, the provision of emergency assistance is preventing food security conditions from deteriorating above Stressed—IPC 2—conditions in northern pastoral areas of Somalia, particularly as locusts have damaged less pastureland than initially anticipated. FEWS NET underscores that sustained assistance is critical for preventing food insecurity in Somalia’s central and northern pastoral areas and southern agro pastoral areas from worsening during the remainder of 2020, as locust related damage, as well as forecast below average October to December deyr rains, could undermine crop and livestock production. Rains Improve Pasture Availability in Kenya Reinfestations Pose Some Risk FEWS NET projects that recent above average rainfall will support pasture growth across most pastoral areas of Kenya in the coming months, though locusts could cause localized forage losses in the country’s northern pastoral counties, including Mandera, Marsabit, Turkana, Samburu, and Wajir counties, should reinfestations occur. Since above average March to May long rains contributed to favorable crop conditions in most areas of Kenya, food availability continues to improve with the harvest of early planted crops however, most pastoral households will likely face Stressed levels of acute food insecurity through September, with FEWS NET projecting the persistence of Crisis conditions in insecure parts of Mandera and flood affected areas of Tana River County during the same period.","['Epidemic', 'Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Insect Infestation']"
" Balochistan, Pakistan, 8 February 2021 Freezing conditions continue to impact Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces in Pakistan. Multiple emergencies including the COVID 19 pandemic, locust invasions and flooding have exacerbated the impact of the weather conditions, with communities in remote areas feeling the force of compounding economic blows, affecting their ability to purchase necessities including food, winter clothing, blankets and medical supplies. The flooding and locust invasion in 2020 impacted two cropping seasons, leaving families with inadequate food supplies to see them through the harsh winter. Women and girls are finding it challenging to go out and collect water in the difficult conditions, which are set to intensify in the coming weeks and continue until March 2021. CARE will be supporting affected communities with essentials to help them face the freezing weather, including cotton mattresses, quilts, shawls, sweaters, woolen caps and gloves benefitting 2,500 people.

" A regional tsunami warning exercise involving sixteen countries of the Pacific is currently taking place from 1 to 5 February to provide participants with the opportunity to test and give feedback on the Northwest Pacific Tsunami Advisory Center NWPTAC enhanced forecasting products. Named PacWave 16 http itic.ioc unesco.org index.php?option com content view category layout blog id 2168 Itemid 2642 , the multi scenario exercise consists of major tsunamis originating in various seismic zones of the Pacific to complement previous scenarios in other places. Participating Member States have selected either a distant or a regional source event which will cause the greatest impact to their country. They will then analyze the information received to assess the threat to their nation and take actions as they deem appropriate. Not only will this allow countries to increase their readiness and raise awareness, especially for communities at risk that need to be prepared for the next tsunami, but it will also help them assess the efficiency of the Pacific Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System PTWS , established under the auspices of UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. In order to provide timely services, alerts warnings and watches have been based primarily on seismic data and the rapid determination of an earthquake’s hypocenter and magnitude, followed by the monitoring of coastal sea level gauges to confirm a tsunami and its severity. Over the last 5 10 years, however, seismic and sea level data availability, analysis methods and communications have improved significantly. Additionally, better and faster numerical models are now able to provide much more accurate forecasts of tsunami impacts along different coasts. PacWave 16 will test the new NWPTAC enhanced products, which consist of an initial text message prepared from pre established tsunami database information.It is followed by text messages accompanied by graphical products that are based on real time simulation techniques. PacWave16 and a similar exercise in 2017 are experimental phases of a full transition to the new products due in 2018. The PTWS was established in 1965 by UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission following the deadly tsunami that hit the coasts of Chile and Japan in 1960. The purpose of the warning system is to facilitate the speedy dissemination of alerts across the region and to support countries’ ability to respond to and mitigate tsunamis locally. Simulation exercises were carried out in 2006, 2008, 2011, 2013 and 2015. Nearly 75 of deadly tsunami events occur in the Pacific Ocean and connected seas. Local tsunamis occur in the Pacific every two years on average. Major events affecting the whole Pacific Ocean occur several times every century. Over the past six years, four devastating tsunamis hit the region 2009 in Samoa and Tonga, 2010 in Chile, 2011 in Japan, and 2013 in the Solomon Islands.

" Save the Children to set up temporary learning and child friendly spaces, deliver cash to families SUVA, Fiji, 21 January 2022 – The race is on to get life saving supplies to children and families in Tonga as water and food supplies dwindle following the volcano and tsunami disaster which struck nearly a week ago. Save the Children will join the response by establishing temporary learning and child friendly spaces to support children impacted by the trauma of recent events, as well as provide school bags, hygiene kits and cash assistance to affected families. Over 80,000 people, including at least 28,000 children, are estimated to have been affected across the country by the eruption and subsequent tsunami. The country, which has a population of about 100,000, is particularly vulnerable to climate threats such as tsunamis, because of rising sea levels. Although the full scale of needs is still being assessed, damage to school infrastructure and learning resources is anticipated, as well as the use of schools as evacuation centers, which could lead to a delay to the start of the 2022 school year initially planned for 31 January. Lost income due to the disaster will likely impact the ability of families to provide for their children’s education and health. There is a risk that school attendance will be affected, as children and youth are required to work, or families are unable to afford to send them due to the economic impact of the disaster. To mitigate the COVID risk, Save the Children will utilise existing staff in country and leverage significant regional expertise in education and emergency cash assistance to support children and families in Tonga. Shairana Ali, CEO Save the Children Fiji, said “We are incredibly concerned about the mental health of children in Tonga. This sort of event will obviously lead to a lot of distress and anxiety, and there is absolutely a need for psychosocial support and counselling for children. “We still don’t have a lot of information about how families have fared on those low lying islands, so we are very concerned for the safety and the wellbeing of children. “Assessments are obviously ongoing to understand the needs of children and families in Tonga. We must ensure that any response is mindful of the COVID risk, while ensuring children get the support they desperately need.” “Utilising existing program staff in Tonga, Save the Children will work to ensure children are safe and supported in this time of disaster through our Child Friendly Spaces. We will also establish temporary learning spaces and deliver distance learning to limit disruption to education as much as possible.” “Save the Children will support families impacted by the disaster with cash assistance. Not only does cash assistance ensure families can purchase the things they need, it supports the recovery of the local economy in the longer term.” The volcano erupted about 65km 40 miles north of the capital Nuku'alofa, and triggered a tsunami which flooded parts of the archipelago. The eruption emitted a plume of ash, steam and gas, rising approximately 20km above the volcano, and blanketing parts of the country with ash and smoke. Power has been restored to 90 of the country and some international phone calls are now available. So far three deaths have been reported and hundreds of buildings destroyed but the exact scale of the damage remains unknown due to the lack of access to some islands. In Tonga, Save the Children supports the Ministry of Education to deliver a 1 million AUD distance learning program, utilising technology to reach outlying islands and remote populations. With the support of the Global Partnership for Education, the Tonga Accelerated Resilience Program https www.globalpartnership.org blog helping students be ready learn whenever disaster strikes TARP develops education systems that are much better prepared for emergencies. Throughout the Pacific, Save the Children delivers Cash and Voucher Assistance programs in emergencies to support families in a fast, effective and dignified way. Cash assistance ensure families can purchase the things they need, when they need it, but it also supports local economic activity.

"ISIOLO, 20 March 2012 IRIN Wildfires have destroyed large tracts of grassland in northern Kenya, giving rise to fears of conflict between pastoralist communities amid an already serious food security crisis. In the areas we have managed to visit, the loss of vegetation is large, at least 20,000 hectares, said an officer with the Kenya Forest service in the town of Wajir, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly. He said an overall assessment to establish the total level of destruction had yet to be conducted. According to Mohamed Wako, an elder, tension is rising along the Isiolo, Garissa and Wajir borders with residents accusing each other of causing the fire. A Wajir resident, Ibrahim Mohamed, said the fire is suspected to have been started by a cartel of traders who are hoping to secure aid agencies' and government contracts to supply fodder in the region. A fortnight ago, residents of the Habaswein area of Wajir barricaded a road to prevent trucks ferrying hay, accusing the truck owners of being behind the inferno. The districts of Wajir North, South and West are the most affected with the fire spreading to parts of neighbouring Isiolo. The wildfire which broke out last month but was stopped, started again two weeks ago and burnt more areas we have not visited. Extensive rangeland has been affected, the forest officer said. We have lost a number of livestock, mainly calves, weak and sick animals that were not able to move quickly, Adan Dualle, a Wajir resident told IRIN, adding Two people burnt by the fire are still at Wajir District Hospital. Some herders have been forced to migrate further north towards Moyale with some crossing the border into Ethiopia. We are already faced with a shortage of pasture. While we had enough just last month, I am afraid the situation will be worse if it fails to rain, said Dualle. At least 500 families from the Biyamadow, Dadachabulla and Sarif areas have been displaced and forced to move to neighbouring districts, he added. A further 150 families had also been forced to flee from Berami Villlage to the Bute and Buna areas, according to a Wajir North District resident, Hussein Nurow. Food insecurity The fire cause unknown is fast spreading in Isiolo's Merti and Garbatulla areas, according to officials. We are unable to control the fire, said Diba Golicha, chairman of the Rangelands Users Association in Merti. The government should give us helicopters or planes to fight this fire. It's spreading fast and getting close to Marsabit north of Isiolo . We also want this matter be investigated. The cause of the fire is being investigated and more resources being mobilized to ensure that it does not spread further and damage infrastructure, according to the upper eastern regional commissioner, Isaiah Nakoru. The March May long rains are forecast to be below average and poorly distributed, meaning that further improvements in pastoral food security are not expected, according to the Famine Early Warning Systems FEWS NET . http www.fews.net pages country.aspx?gb ke Food security in the area had improved after good October December 2011 short rains regenerated pasture, increasing household milk availability and incomes.

"The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has approved from the Disaster Relief Fund two grants totalling 1.1 million to two agencies for providing relief to flood victims in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in the Mainland. Announcing the grants today June 23 , a spokesman for the Government said that the two grants one of 0.55 million to Amity Foundation, Hong Kong and one of 0.55 million to Oxfam Hong Kong will be used to provide rice, cooking oil and instant noodles to around 12 000 flood victims to address their imminent need. As the targeted localities of the two relief agencies are different, there will be no overlapping of resources. The grants were approved under the fast track mechanism set up on the advice of the Disaster Relief Fund Advisory Committee to facilitate relief agencies kick starting first phase emergency relief work. To ensure that the money is used for the designated purposes, the relief agencies will be asked to submit evaluation reports and audited accounts on the use of the grants after the relief projects have been completed, the spokesman said.

"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE AHRC STM 192 2011 December 9, 2011 A Statement by the Asian Human Rights Commission on the Occasion of the International Human Rights Day, December 10, 2011 PAKISTAN The government dodges the international community on civil and political rights The full report is available for download at http www.humanrights.asia resources hrreport 2011 AHRC SPR 008 2011 view. The state has become dysfunctional in providing basic human rights to the people. Though the parliament exists it either cannot assert its constitutional duties or does not want to assert itself in the presence of the powerful military which is dominating both internal and external affairs. The Pakistani society and the government remain under the strong grip of the military which does not allow them to interfere in the affairs of the armed forces. Pakistan remains a highly militarized society where economic, political, foreign affairs and judicial policies are dictated by the armed forces. The laws for the benefit of women, religious minorities and against torture and enforced disappearances cannot be made without the prior approval from the military. The parliament has been made redundant and its decisions are occasionally reverted through the judiciary at the behest of the military. The year 2011 was no different from the previous years for the human rights defenders. This year it was more open and blatant when government ratifies the different covenants and conventions of UN. The government has still not developed any mechanism to provide protection for the human rights defenders and sometimes it is observed that law enforcement authorities were harsher with the HR defenders. The Asian Human Rights Commission has documented the killing of 18 human rights defenders during the year by the state intelligence agencies. The government of Pakistan has dodged not only the UN but also the European Union who pursued the government to withdraw all its reservations on the many articles of the ICCPR and the CAT. The European Union had conveyed that these reservations had made Pakistan ineligible for the Generalised System of Preferences GSP Plus status to be accorded in 2014 by the European Union. To settle the issue, the Prime Minister chaired an Inter Ministerial Meeting, the cabinet, at the end of June 2011, in which it was decided to withdraw its reservations on Articles 6, 7, 12, 13, 18, 19 and 40 of ICCPR. The reservation on Article 3 was narrowed down to Personal Law and Law of Evidence, and the reservation on Article 25 was restricted to the election of the President of Pakistan. On the CAT it was decided to withdraw reservations on Articles 3, 4, 6, 12, 13 and 16. The reservation on Article 8 was retained. The declarations on Article 20 as provided in Article 28 1 and Article 30 1 were also retained. This eye wash effort, to make fools of the international community, was done by the government to avail itself of multiple trade concessions, privileges and enhanced trade activities with the European Union. The year 2011 started with the killings of hundreds of persons including those of high profile personalities the governor of a province and a federal minister of minority affairs, by the extremist religious groups who infiltrated the law enforcement agencies. The arrest of a Christian lady, Aasia Bibi, on baseless Blasphemy charges from some mosque leaders took religious intolerance and fanaticism to its highest peak. The state played a dubious role to appease religious extremism. It remained a silent spectator in the killings of Mr. Salman Taseer, former governor of Punjab province and former federal minister of minority affairs, a Christian minister in cabinet. The government's ineptitude to stop religious and sectarian intolerance has strengthened the banned militant religious groups so that they are able to organize and collect funds in the streets and hold huge rallies. This ineptitude of the government has encouraged the forced conversion to Islam of girls from religious minority groups. In total throughout the country during the year around 1,800 women from Hindu and Christian groups were forced to convert to Islam by different methods particularly though abduction and rape. The government had extended his appeasement policy towards the fundamentalists and helped them to unleash their forces of tolerance and enlightenment which in result made the Muslim extremists the ''Heroes of Islam''. The government's actions have polarized the society on a religion basis which is harming the democratic process. During the year, in Karachi, capital of Sindh alone, 1,800 persons were killed and political parties from ruling coalition were involved in ethnic target killings. The minister of interior says that during two years 3938 people were killed in Karachi city. In Balochistan during the year disappearances by the plain clothed persons continued and more than 100 persons were disappeared. Around 100 missing persons were extrajudicially killed and the family members of the victims claim that these persons were abducted by law enforcement agencies. Nearly 161 persons were laid with blasphemy charges in the country during the year so far. Nine of them were extrajudicially murdered. Murders in the name of Karo kari, killings in the name of honour , are reported daily. Target killings in Karachi and different parts of Balochistan are on the rise. Sectarian killings have been continuing, even without any consideration of Eid days or Ramadan Islamic festivals . The government has not made any progress in the draconian Blasphemy law which has taken many lives including high profile personalities of the government but, instead, the authorities are covertly patronizing militant groups. The courts, which claimed to be independent after 2007, have proved themselves to be friends of the militants and the terrorists. In many cases terrorists were released by the courts, especially from the higher courts on the plea that the prosecution has not made its case properly but no reforms were suggested to the prosecution. The high profile terrorists, who openly boast of having killed hundreds of people, were released by the courts. The government has not introduced any reforms in the judicial criminal justice system. The present criminal justice system is generally based on torture, ill treatment and corruption which always provide impunity to the perpetrators. In addition the Shariah laws are thought to be the best way to get impunity. The two laws are running parallel to each other, the Islamic and secular. The rule of law has deteriorated because of this system. The investigation system remains the main cause of torture and ill treatment and illegal detention. Torture is still treated as the best way for the investigation system. Every year thousands of people are tortured in custody at either the police or army's illegal detention centers. Every police station in the country is running private torture centers besides the police stations themselves or conducting torture in private houses. The military, navy, Air force and Para military forces are all running torture cells. They not only torture their opponents but also using torture cells to settle their petty issues. During the year 2011 government could not stop the enforced disappearances by the military, Para Military forces and their spy agencies. A new process in the cases of disappearances was introduced by killing the persons extrajudicially so as to eliminate the evidence of enforced disappearances and torture in custody. During the year 2011 more than 100 persons were extrajudicially killed after being reported missing due to arrest by the law enforcement agencies, particularly by the Frontier Corp FC , a Par Military organization, and spies from the intelligence agencies. Since July 2010 to date, 215 missing persons' bullet riddled bodies were found abandoned. The open secret of disappearances illustrates the grip the military establishment retains over Pakistani society, including its dysfunctional justice system and feeble civilian government, which has repeatedly vowed to stop the problem. A government commission was informed about the numbers of missing people but has traced only some dozens out of the hundreds of missing people. It has also been publicly acknowledged that the Pakistani intelligence agencies are involved, but no one has been held accountable. The military does not allow the judiciary to interfere with its affairs and the judiciary itself keeps its distance from taking the cases against the military because judicial officials know their fate well. The poverty index has declined in comparison with last year. 30.6 per cent of Pakistanis were living below the poverty line in 1998 99. 28.3 were living below the poverty line in 2004 5 World Bank . One per cent 0.64 per cent plus 0.37 per cent of households owned over 35 acres. 9.66 per cent owned between five and 12.5 acres.18.25 per cent households owned less than five acres of land. This year the floods have added more havoc to the poverty ridden people. More than 200,000 people are displaced and hundreds of thousand houses were destroyed in the floods. The negligence of the authorities and improper mechanisms to deal with natural disasters has put the lives of millions of people in peril after the heavy rains. This year, the floods have claimed about 1040 people, directly affected 2.2 millions, 20 millions in overall, collapsed houses of 1.5 million, inundated 4.2 million acres of land. The loss of crops alone is estimated to be Rs. 5.6 billion while three millions are still in need of food while some affected were dying of hunger and starvation. The most vulnerable groups exposed to flood and rains were children and women, pregnant women in particular, who are the majority of deaths and the affected. Yet, the government of Pakistan failed to manage emergency to secure people's lives despite having gone through a similar catastrophe last year. The government aid for the affected failed to reach them due to the corrupt bureaucratic system dealing with humanitarian aid. Freedom of expression and the press has remained a main focal point for the military, its intelligence agencies and for religious fundamentalists, including the powerful persons. Though the government has provided freedom of media without any interference and not a single case was reported for twisting the arms of the media. But many cases of involvement of the military intelligence agencies in killing, abduction and disappearances of the journalists were reported. 16 journalists were killed, among them five journalists were abducted by the spies of state intelligence agencies, kept incommunicado in different torture cells, tortured and their bullet ridden bodies were dumped on the road side. Five journalists were killed in bomb blasts while performing their professional duties, six journalists were killed in target killings. One journalist is missing after abduction by the plain clothed persons. The unanimous passage of the 18th amendment to Pakistan's constitution by parliament last year was a major development to establish a parliamentary government system. The amendment constitutes one of the most dramatic de concentrations of power in Pakistan since the drafting of its 1973 constitution and deleted all the amendments made in the constitution by the military rulers. Through the amendment the powers of the federal government were devolved to the provinces but after the passage of more than 18 months the process of devolution were stopped for unknown reasons. It is a good premonition that government has not executed anyone since October 2008. Around 8000 persons are waiting in the death row.

" HAITI August 14, 2021 – On Saturday, August 14, around 8 30 am, an earthquake measured at 7.2 magnitude struck the southern areas of Les Cayes, Jeremie, Saint Louis de Sud, Aquin, Petit Trou de Nippes, Anse a Veau, and Cavaillon, followed by several aftershocks. Vibrations could be felt as far as Jamaica, about 200 miles away. Local news outlets reported earlier that the sea in Jeremie receded, which might have been a sign of a tsunami, but warnings were rescinded later. Local authorities have declared a state of emergency for one month, seeking the assistance of humanitarian aid. Hospitals in Haiti nearest the affected regions are reportedly over capacity. The death toll has risen to more than 300 , with more than 1,800 people injured numbers are subject to change , according to local reports. Residents of the affected towns have been trying to locate family and friends missing or feared dead. Ongoing search parties have been formed to search for people hidden under rubbles. “The Adventist Development and Relief Agency ADRA was one of the first aid relief organizations to reach the affected area of Saint Louis de Sud in Haiti. From our assessments, the main concern is to care for the injured. At this moment, evaluations of the damages are being carried out. One of the main challenges is the extreme complexity of ‘gang’ blocks that do not allow easy access to affected areas. We are also concerned about the pending storm Grace and the already delicate situation in Haiti due to violence and the massive displacement of populations. The situation is extremely complex,” says Elian Giaccarini, ADRA’s emergency management coordinator for the Caribbean. ADRA has been operating in Haiti for over 30 years providing support for nutrition, agriculture, water and primary education programs in the north and north east central parts of Haiti, targeting a population of 1 million people. This is the second time a major earthquake struck Haiti in a decade. In 2010, a 7.0 magnitude earthquake killed nearly 250,000 people.

" SG SM 20451 Following is the text of UN Secretary‑General António Guterres’ remarks on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, observed today I am pleased to join you on this important day for the United Nations and for the world. Violence against women and girls is a pervasive global human rights challenge, rooted in unequal gender power relations, structural inequality and discrimination. That is why we launched the global UNiTE to End Violence against Women campaign. The COVID 19 crisis has further exposed violence against women and girls as a global emergency requiring urgent action. Rates of violence, in particular domestic violence, have dramatically escalated around the world. It is clear that the pandemic has exacerbated risk factors and laid bare the shortcomings of previous efforts to prevent and respond to this shocking emergency. In April this year, I urged the international community to end the shadow pandemic of gender‑based violence once and for all and make prevention and the redress of violence a key part of national responses to COVID‑19. My appeal was answered with strong commitment and support from 146 Member States and observers. I reiterated and relaunched that appeal several times I do it again today. I have been heartened to see so many Governments taking action to address gender‑based violence during COVID‑19. Today we will hear from Member States about just some of these promising practices, ranging from funding and support for critical services and innovative justice sector responses, to awareness campaigns that challenge harmful gender stereotypes and norms. Efforts to date have not only involved States. Civil society partners and grass‑roots women’s rights organizations have been indispensable in preventing and responding to violence against women and girls in the context of the COVID‑19 pandemic. The Generation Equality Forum and its Action Coalitions, led by diverse and interdisciplinary leadership teams, will work to deliver concrete and transformative change across six critical themes, including an Action Coalition specifically targeting gender‑based violence. This year the United Nations flagship, Spotlight Initiative, in partnership with the European Union, has expanded to three new subregions, investing in prevention and transformative sustainable solutions aligned to the Sustainable Development Goals. However, much work remains to be done. Millions of women are being pushed further into poverty by the COVID‑19 crisis and all forms of violence against them are rising. In this context, the global community must continue to build on the momentum we have created to prioritize the voices, experiences and needs of women and girls. We must take into account the needs of women who experience violence, particularly those who face multiple and intersecting forms of violence and discrimination. This means emerging from this crisis with women’s leadership front and centre in constructing the solutions we need. Our priorities must first and foremost include urgent and flexible funding for women’s rights organizations, who so often act as first responders during crises. It is critical that services for survivors are regarded as essential and remain open, with adequate resources and measures in place to support health and social services to care for survivors of violence. Programming should also prioritize the quality and continuity of police and justice sector responses. But measures should not only focus on intervening once violence has occurred. They should aim to reduce the risk of violence occurring in the first place. This includes providing financial and material support to women and households encouraging positive messaging around gender equality, stereotypes and norms supporting access to mental health services and engaging key stakeholders, including women and girls, men and boys, and traditional and faith‑based leaders. The more we know about the gender‑based violence, the more we can effectively address it. For this reason, measures should also focus on supporting institutions to collect and analyse data, where it is safe and ethical to do so. We have already made much progress in highlighting violence against women and girls as one of the most pressing issues of our time. But we must go further – much further. Violence against women and girls is a horrible and widespread affront to their human rights, and a blight on all our societies. Let us all UNiTE to end the violence during COVID‑19 and beyond. Thank you.",['Epidemic']
" NAIROBI, 21 April 2022 – A poor start to the rainy season in the Horn of Africa has added to fears that the worst drought in decades could soon have catastrophic results, with the crisis worsened by the war in Ukraine driving up food prices and diverting international attention, Save the Children said. More than 16 million https www.wfp.org news 13 million people facing severe hunger drought grips horn africa people—including many children—are already in dire need of food aid in Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia, which are now staring at an unprecedented fourth consecutive failed rainy season, having received below average rains so far this March to May wet season. Kenya and Ethiopia have only received light showers after seven weeks of the rainy season. Forecasts from the Kenya Meteorological Department and Ethiopia’s Crop Monitor for Early Warning point to a below average season, warning this could push more people into a desperate situation. Already, 3.5 million people in Kenya are short of food and up to 6.5 million people in Southern Ethiopia need aid. In Somalia, nearly one third of the population, or 4.8 million people, are facing acute food shortage and the UN https www.wfp.org news joint fao ocha unicef wfp press release drought emergency somalia has warned of a looming famine in three months due to the drought causing La Niña weather system, inadequate humanitarian assistance, and rising food prices. This has raised fears of a repeat of a 2011 famine that killed 260,000 people, half aged under five. Save the Children staff in Somalia said only a few pockets of the drought stricken country had received small amounts of rain two weeks into the season. Forecast https www.fsnau.org downloads Somalia Updated IPC and Famine Risk Analysis Technical Release March June 2022 8 Apr 2022.pdf s show an increased likelihood of below average rain this April June season in central and southern Somalia where millions of pastoralists have been forced from their homes to live in displacement camps. On top of one of the worst droughts in decades and huge funding shortfalls, the escalation of war in Ukraine seven weeks ago is threatening to push families and children in the Horn of Africa further into misery, Save the Children said. The cost of food in the region was already on an upward trend, driven by climate shocks, locust invasions, conflict, and tough economic times brought about by the COVID 19 pandemic. But the escalation of the conflict in Ukraine has created shockwaves in the food markets. Bread is a staple food in East Africa, with wheat and wheat products accounting for one third https docs.wfp.org api documents WFP 0000137369 download of the average cereal consumption in the region. The demand is mainly met by imports 84 , of which 90 of wheat imports come from Russia 72 and Ukraine 18 i https outlook.office.com mail AAMkADE0Yjc2NzM2LTIwNDUtNDRmYy1iMmEyLTQ3ZmM3YTljMTVkZAAuAAAAAAC8t4VZDALsRqIfMy2yp1ZhAQCyesZmBf0JR4r07NWca6 2BTAAAA 2BMz7AAA 3D id AAQkADE0Yjc2NzM2LTIwNDUtNDRmYy1iMmEyLTQ3ZmM3YTljMTVkZAAQAGafDJIVuk7mu6 2B70ouL31I 3D edn1 and with prices rising in the past seven weeks. Russia and Ukraine also account for nearly three quarters of global exports https apps.fas.usda.gov psdonline circulars oilseeds.pdf of sunflower oil, also a widely used commodity in the region. In Somalia’s Puntland state, the price of wheat flour has jumped from 26 to 32 per 50kg bag, and up to 36 in the towns of Garowe and Qardho ii https outlook.office.com mail AAMkADE0Yjc2NzM2LTIwNDUtNDRmYy1iMmEyLTQ3ZmM3YTljMTVkZAAuAAAAAAC8t4VZDALsRqIfMy2yp1ZhAQCyesZmBf0JR4r07NWca6 2BTAAAA 2BMz7AAA 3D id AAQkADE0Yjc2NzM2LTIwNDUtNDRmYy1iMmEyLTQ3ZmM3YTljMTVkZAAQAGafDJIVuk7mu6 2B70ouL31I 3D edn2 . In the capital of Mogadishu, the price of a 3 litre container of cooking oil had tripled to 9 in March this year from 3 in January. Prices in rural areas have surged higher, up to 12 a container, which is attributed to an increase in the price of transportation as a result of higher fuel prices. In Ethiopia, the price of sorghum and maize increased by 9 and 4 , respectively, between February and March, while its protein rich staple food, teff, saw its prices jump by 1 from 0.93 per kilo in March to 0.94 in April. iii https outlook.office.com mail AAMkADE0Yjc2NzM2LTIwNDUtNDRmYy1iMmEyLTQ3ZmM3YTljMTVkZAAuAAAAAAC8t4VZDALsRqIfMy2yp1ZhAQCyesZmBf0JR4r07NWca6 2BTAAAA 2BMz7AAA 3D id AAQkADE0Yjc2NzM2LTIwNDUtNDRmYy1iMmEyLTQ3ZmM3YTljMTVkZAAQAGafDJIVuk7mu6 2B70ouL31I 3D edn3 Save the Children staff are also reporting massive price hikes for sunflower oil. Besides immediate food access and availability, there are concerns over the longer term impact on food production due to higher fuel prices and soaring costs of fertilizer. Russia is the world’s largest exporter of nitrogen fertilizers and the conflict has pushed up prices at a time when the main planting season March to May is underway in Africa. In Kenya, the price of a bag of fertilizer jumped by 50 last year to about US 60 and has risen further to US 70 iv https outlook.office.com mail AAMkADE0Yjc2NzM2LTIwNDUtNDRmYy1iMmEyLTQ3ZmM3YTljMTVkZAAuAAAAAAC8t4VZDALsRqIfMy2yp1ZhAQCyesZmBf0JR4r07NWca6 2BTAAAA 2BMz7AAA 3D id AAQkADE0Yjc2NzM2LTIwNDUtNDRmYy1iMmEyLTQ3ZmM3YTljMTVkZAAQAGafDJIVuk7mu6 2B70ouL31I 3D edn4 since 24 February. This will mean smallholder farmers use fewer fertilizers resulting in lower productivity, while large scale farmers are hit by fuel costs for tractors and other machinery. Save the Children’s Country Director for Somalia, Mohamud Mohamed Hassan, said “As Somalia is facing yet another cycle of drought, the situation is getting worse by the day and the war in Ukraine has dealt a serious blow to what was already a perilous situation. Somalia relies heavily on food imports to feed its people.

With skyrocketing food and fuel prices across Somalia and the Horn of Africa, we reiterate that the time to act and avert a catastrophe is now.” In Somalia, more than 720,000 people have abandoned their homes in search of food and water in the past eight months with their ability to cope already eroded by decades of conflict, political instability, climate shocks and COVID 19.

Malnutrition cases are also soaring in Kenya where 755,000 https reliefweb.int node 3833088 children require urgent treatment for acute malnutrition, with 103,000 pregnant and breast feeding mothers acutely malnourished and in need of urgent treatment. Save the Children’s Country Director for Kenya, Yvonne Arunga, said “In Kenya’s arid and semi arid regions, people are facing an emergency food situation and children are having to contend with one meal a day. Without urgent intervention, every hour pushes families and children closer and closer to the brink of starvation. We are urgently calling on the international community to make more funds available for the drought response before the situation gets out of hand.” There is a US 4.4 billion UN humanitarian appeal https reliefweb.int node 3825898 for Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia but funding is extremely low, with concerns that the Ukraine conflict is dominating the international spotlight with other global crises starting to fall below the radar. In Ethiopia, Save the Children is warning that a prolonged and devastating drought is grinding away at the resilience of children and families, already worn down by 16 months of conflict and two years of the COVID 19 pandemic. At least 8.1 million people need immediate food aid, with over 286,000 people forced to abandon their homes in search of food and water. vii https outlook.office.com mail AAMkADE0Yjc2NzM2LTIwNDUtNDRmYy1iMmEyLTQ3ZmM3YTljMTVkZAAuAAAAAAC8t4VZDALsRqIfMy2yp1ZhAQCyesZmBf0JR4r07NWca6 2BTAAAA 2BMz7AAA 3D id AAQkADE0Yjc2NzM2LTIwNDUtNDRmYy1iMmEyLTQ3ZmM3YTljMTVkZAAQAGafDJIVuk7mu6 2B70ouL31I 3D edn7 Save the Children said pastoralist families have now lost over 1.46 million livestock. This has led to children missing out on milk, their main source of nutrition, with up to 890,000 children aged under five now suffering from malnutrition. Save the Children’s Country Director for Ethiopia, Xavier Joubert, said “The hunger crisis in Ethiopia is predicted to get worse in the coming months due to the predicted fourth below average rainy season and the approaching lean season which runs between June to September. Families in the Dawa zone of Somali region have been reported to adopt all possible coping mechanisms due to the food shortage, including skipping meals and reducing food portions.” Save the Children has worked in the Horn of Africa for over 70 years and is a national and international leader in humanitarian and development programming in health, nutrition, water hygiene and sanitation, education, child protection and child rights governance. In 2021, Save the Children reached 12,185,726 people in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia, including more than 7,624,620 children. i https outlook.office.com mail AAMkADE0Yjc2NzM2LTIwNDUtNDRmYy1iMmEyLTQ3ZmM3YTljMTVkZAAuAAAAAAC8t4VZDALsRqIfMy2yp1ZhAQCyesZmBf0JR4r07NWca6 2BTAAAA 2BMz7AAA 3D id AAQkADE0Yjc2NzM2LTIwNDUtNDRmYy1iMmEyLTQ3ZmM3YTljMTVkZAAQAGafDJIVuk7mu6 2B70ouL31I 3D ednref1 WFP 2022 Implications of Ukraine Conflict on Food Access and Availability in the Eastern Africa Region ii https outlook.office.com mail AAMkADE0Yjc2NzM2LTIwNDUtNDRmYy1iMmEyLTQ3ZmM3YTljMTVkZAAuAAAAAAC8t4VZDALsRqIfMy2yp1ZhAQCyesZmBf0JR4r07NWca6 2BTAAAA 2BMz7AAA 3D id AAQkADE0Yjc2NzM2LTIwNDUtNDRmYy1iMmEyLTQ3ZmM3YTljMTVkZAAQAGafDJIVuk7mu6 2B70ouL31I 3D ednref2 https reliefweb.int report somalia somalia joint market and supply chain update 13th march 2022 20th march 2022 https reliefweb.int node 3829334 iiWFP 2022 Implications of Ukraine Conflict on Food Access and Availability in the Eastern Africa Region iii https outlook.office.com mail AAMkADE0Yjc2NzM2LTIwNDUtNDRmYy1iMmEyLTQ3ZmM3YTljMTVkZAAuAAAAAAC8t4VZDALsRqIfMy2yp1ZhAQCyesZmBf0JR4r07NWca6 2BTAAAA 2BMz7AAA 3D id AAQkADE0Yjc2NzM2LTIwNDUtNDRmYy1iMmEyLTQ3ZmM3YTljMTVkZAAQAGafDJIVuk7mu6 2B70ouL31I 3D ednref3 Ethiopia Joint Market Monitoring Initiative and cereal retailer in Addis Ababa iv https outlook.office.com mail AAMkADE0Yjc2NzM2LTIwNDUtNDRmYy1iMmEyLTQ3ZmM3YTljMTVkZAAuAAAAAAC8t4VZDALsRqIfMy2yp1ZhAQCyesZmBf0JR4r07NWca6 2BTAAAA 2BMz7AAA 3D id AAQkADE0Yjc2NzM2LTIwNDUtNDRmYy1iMmEyLTQ3ZmM3YTljMTVkZAAQAGafDJIVuk7mu6 2B70ouL31I 3D ednref4 Business Daily 2022 Fertiliser prices spike after Russia Ukraine war https www.businessdailyafrica.com bd markets commodities fertliser prices spike after russia ukraine war 3733922 v https outlook.office.com mail AAMkADE0Yjc2NzM2LTIwNDUtNDRmYy1iMmEyLTQ3ZmM3YTljMTVkZAAuAAAAAAC8t4VZDALsRqIfMy2yp1ZhAQCyesZmBf0JR4r07NWca6 2BTAAAA 2BMz7AAA 3D id AAQkADE0Yjc2NzM2LTIwNDUtNDRmYy1iMmEyLTQ3ZmM3YTljMTVkZAAQAGafDJIVuk7mu6 2B70ouL31I 3D ednref5 Implications of Ukraine Conflict on Food Access and Availability in the Eastern Africa Region https reliefweb.int node 3834198 vi https outlook.office.com mail AAMkADE0Yjc2NzM2LTIwNDUtNDRmYy1iMmEyLTQ3ZmM3YTljMTVkZAAuAAAAAAC8t4VZDALsRqIfMy2yp1ZhAQCyesZmBf0JR4r07NWca6 2BTAAAA 2BMz7AAA 3D id AAQkADE0Yjc2NzM2LTIwNDUtNDRmYy1iMmEyLTQ3ZmM3YTljMTVkZAAQAGafDJIVuk7mu6 2B70ouL31I 3D ednref6 Urgent support needed for 1.4 million children likely to suffer from acute malnutrition in Somalia Unicef UK https www.unicef.org.uk press releases urgent support needed for 1 4 million children likely to suffer from acute malnutrition in somalia text Mogadishu 2C 2015 20February 202022 3A 20More,million 20people 20on 20the 20brink. vii https outlook.office.com mail AAMkADE0Yjc2NzM2LTIwNDUtNDRmYy1iMmEyLTQ3ZmM3YTljMTVkZAAuAAAAAAC8t4VZDALsRqIfMy2yp1ZhAQCyesZmBf0JR4r07NWca6 2BTAAAA 2BMz7AAA 3D id AAQkADE0Yjc2NzM2LTIwNDUtNDRmYy1iMmEyLTQ3ZmM3YTljMTVkZAAQAGafDJIVuk7mu6 2B70ouL31I 3D ednref7 OCHA data.",['Drought']

" Highlights • The Hunga Tonga Hunga Taa’pai volcano is simmering down, but it left a shroud of ash over the mainland, floodwaters inland and caused damage to infrastructure, particularly in the small islands. • Clean drinking water supply and environmental clean up are among the priority humanitarian needs initially expressed. • UNICEF is mobilizing emergency supplies prepositioned in the Australian humanitarian warehouse in Brisbane and the UNICEF warehouse in Fiji for immediate deployment to Tonga. Situation Overview Humanitarian Needs Three days after the explosive eruption that triggered a tsunami, the Hunga Tonga Hunga Taa’pai volcano in Tonga appears to be simmering down as the volcanic activity has been downgraded to Alert Level 3, meaning that eruption hazards are now confined near its vent. Communications to Tonga are still a challenge. While local telecommunications within the main island of Tongatapu have been restored, overseas communications still depend on a few satellite phones operating in the island. Early reports describe substantial ash coverage around Nuku’alofa, inundation of coastal areas and damage to some infrastructure. Two casualties were confirmed. While damage to agriculture is less than what was feared, concerns about water supply, air quality and availability of fuel have been raised. Outbreak of waterborne diseases is also feared as tidal surges caused flooding 2 3 blocks inland. Aerial surveillance showed significant infrastructure damage to small islands in the Haapai group, north of the capital. The main airport in the capital is not yet operational as the ash covering the runaway is still being cleared. Repatriation flights from New Zealand and Fiji have also been cancelled because of the ash cloud. Entry to Tonga remains restricted because of COVID 19 protocols.","['Flood', 'Tsunami', 'Volcano']"

There was evidence of local communities having effected repairs themselves. Of note, some of the smaller islands in the Semirara and Cuyo Islands rely on seaweed cultivation for the majority of their income and this has been badly affected by the typhoon. This has impacted their abilty to purchase essential items, such as food and materials to repair the seaweed beds.

" “We must not wait for famine to be declared to act” Trócaire today warned of a rapid deterioration in the food crisis in drought ravaged Somalia, saying the international community must not wait for famine to be declared to adequately respond. Trócaire Country Director Manager for Somalia, Paul Healy, said the situation is the worst in living memory, with the number of people experiencing acute hunger already surpassing the number affected in the famine of 2011, when more than a quarter of a million people died. One in six people in the East African country are now facing extreme hunger. The crisis is being replicated across the Horn and East Africa, including Ethiopia and South Sudan where Trócaire also operates, with one person now thought to be dying in the region every 36 seconds. “Somalia is on the fast track towards famine, but we should not have to wait until famine is officially declared for a proper response. The international community needs to act and act now. What we are seeing on the ground is devastating. People are suffering. Children are dying.” said Mr Healy. Mr Healy was speaking after the broadcast of a harrowing report on BBC One TV from a Trócaire hospital in Dollow, Gedo region, southern Somalia, where the aid agency provides critical health and nutrition support to over 200,000 people. The report captured the death from hunger of a two year old boy at the Dollow Health Referral Centre, and his subsequent burial afterwards by his family. “This was heart breaking to witness. But this is the reality our team on the ground and the communities are facing daily. Hunger is claiming lives at an ever increasing rate. The alarm has been sounding for months but the international community and governments have not adequately responded. How many more people need to die before the world acts?” He said climate change has wiped out crops and three million livestock have died in Somalia since mid 2021, with large parts of the country about to enter what is projected to be its fifth failed rainy season. A failed rainfall season in late 2022 would leave no prospects for recovery until at least the start of the next rainfall season in April 2023. Mr Healy said a million people have been displaced in Somalia this year, 800,000 due to drought. “The crisis has been exacerbated in many places by conflict, and by rising food prices due in part to the war in Ukraine, and reduced supply from neighbouring countries also struggling. This has resulted in sorghum, maize and wheat prices reaching near‑record to record levels in July, beyond the reach of most poor households who depend heavily on market purchases to access food.” Mr Healy added that women are particularly hard hit by the crisis, reducing their own food to feed their children. Across the Horn of Africa region, increasing numbers of girls are in danger of leaving school as the crisis deepens, putting them at higher risk of child marriage and FGM. The number of children at risk of dropping out of school in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia due to the impact of the drought has tripled in the space of three months – from 1.1. million to an estimated 3.3 million children. Mr Healy said alarming levels of mortality and malnutrition are already occurring. “We have seen the number of malnourished children coming to our health centres in Gedo for treatment triple in recent months. “We are barely able to cope with the numbers in Gedo. Our stabilisation units are full. It questions what value the world is putting on human lives.”.",['Drought']

" Message from the General Secretary 2019 was the first year of implementation of ACT’s new Global Strategy, Hope in Action Putting People First. Throughout the year, ACT continued to live into this theme through our work in humanitarian response, development and advocacy. ACT’s work on Gender Justice gained significant momentum with the launch of the Gender Justice Program, and its engagement in several external processes such as the ICPD 25 conference and the Beijing 25 review process. I had the privilege of being the first faith actor ever to be invited to be on the expert panel during the 52nd Commission on Population and Development at the UN. The implementation of global frameworks, such as the Paris Agreement, the 2030 Agenda, the Global Compact on Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration and the Global Compact on Refugees were the central motives of the programmes on climate justice as well as migration and displacement, both in our advocacy and programmatically. In addition to the major humanitarian response of Cyclone Idai in Southern Africa, the area of Emergency Preparedness and Humanitarian Response continued to deliver on two central elements for enhancing the effectiveness of the Alliance’s Humanitarian Mechanism the finalisation of Emergency Preparedness and Response Plans EPRPs and a revision of the Humanitarian Mechanism. We have witnessed increased relevance of the Alliance in various thematic and programmatic areas, and cooperation with external partners throughout 2019. ACT has been invited to engage in high level spaces, for example as a co chair of the newly formed UN Multi Faith Advisory Council, in the Partnership for Religion and Development, at the World Economic Forum, in the consultations of various UN organisations, and in the central global policy processes which are of relevance to ACT’s Global Strategy. I am also happy to report a renewed energy, increased cohesion, and improved collaboration in various ACT forums since the Assembly. We are confident that these improvements will help to strengthen the overall impact of the Alliance. I thank you for your continued support and commitment to the Alliance.","['Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Tropical Cyclone']"
"Farmers disproportionately bear the burden of climate change and the extreme unpredictable weather it brings. This is particularly true in Sub Saharan Africa, where in the past year alone farmers in some areas have faced severe drought while others experienced heavy, unseasonal rains. Timely and actionable information could help farmers to maintain their main source of food and income in a changing climate. With support from USAID, a research team from the Tegemeo Institute of Agricultural Policy and Development at Egerton University, Kenya, has launched new research to evaluate the impacts of a government program that provides farmers weather and market information to their phones. This US 449,255 KSH 49,597,752 three year study is testing how access to weather and market advisories could help farmers adapt to climate change while increasing their overall productivity and resilience. “Kenya’s agriculture is mostly rain fed and hence highly susceptible to raising temperatures and drought,” said Dr. Mercy Kamau, the project’s principal investigator and senior research fellow at Tegemeo Institute. “Innovations that enhance farmers’ ability to adapt to climate change such as weather information for decision making are critical, particularly for women and other vulnerable groups.” Leveraging Information and Communications Technology ICT for Agriculture A lack of information can create barriers for farmers to adapt to climate change. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, adaptation reduces vulnerability to climate change by increasing the ability to absorb its impacts and remain resilient. For farmers, adaptation strategies include improved seeds and other inputs that increase productivity as well as climate smart technologies, innovations and management practices TIMPS that reduce farmers’ exposure to climate risks. Agro weather and market advisories are central to the Kenya Climate Smart Agriculture Project KCSAP , a 2017 2022 Government of Kenya project jointly supported by the World Bank to benefit small scale farming communities. The KCSAP sends these advisories by text message to farmers’ phones as a way to empower them to increase their agricultural productivity and adapt to climate change. KCSAP also leverages the expertise of government agencies to tailor the advisories for individual rural communities. The Kenya Meteorology Department MED contributes localized weather forecasts to 30 days without compromising on accuracy. The Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization KALRO guides farmers in selecting climate adaptation strategies that will be most effective for their agro ecological zones and priority value chains. Kamau and her team are evaluating the impacts of the KCSAP while also building the first evidence from a national program on how weather and market advisories impact farmers’ decision making related to climate adaptation. This multi faceted study will measure these advisories’ impacts on productivity and household wellbeing, how farmers perceive and value them, as well as how to improve access to them particularly for women and other vulnerable groups. “A country wide government project providing agro weather advisories through digital and conventional channels offers an opportunity to verify the already existing evidence at scale, and inform on opportunities for further investments,” said Kamau. Leading Research on Rural Resilience Agriculture is critical for Kenya’s economy. According to World Bank data, agriculture accounts for over half of GDP and employment and is the main source of the nation’s exports. Agriculture is the largest source of income for all households in Kenya’s rural areas. Kenya is also disproportionately vulnerable to climate change. The Centre for Global Development ranks Kenya 13th out of 233 countries for direct risks from extreme weather and 71st of 233 for overall vulnerability to climate change. “Changes in rainfall and temperature patterns threaten agricultural production and increase the vulnerability of people dependent on agriculture for their livelihoods,” said Kamau. The project is funded by the Feed the Future Advancing Local Leadership Innovation Networks ALL IN initiative, an innovative collaboration between the Kenya based development think tank International Center for Evaluation and Development ICED and the U.S. based Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Markets, Risk Resilience at the University of California, Davis. ALL IN builds on research capacity in African countries by inverting the traditional model of research collaborations led from U.S. universities. With funding through ALL IN, researchers at African institutions lead these collaborations, leveraging their local knowledge, skills, ideas and networks to build actionable evidence for effective policy. “ALL IN projects are led by researchers who understand the context and culture on this continent and who are closely related to policy makers and understand the intricacies of policy,” said ICED president and CEO David Ameyaw.",['Drought']
"Bulletin of the Global Volcanism Network, vol. 45, no. 5 May 2020 Managing Editor Edward Venzke. Edited by A. Elizabeth Crafford. Manam Papua New Guinea Minor explosive activity, continued thermal activity, and SO2 emissions, October 2019 March 2020. Please cite this report as Global Volcanism Program, 2020. Report on Manam Papua New Guinea Crafford, A.E., and Venzke, E., eds. . Bulletin of the Global Volcanism Network , 45 5. Smithsonian Institution. Manam Papua New Guinea 4.08°S, 145.037°E summit elev. 1807 m All times are local unless otherwise noted Manam is a basaltic andesitic stratovolcano that lies 13 km off the northern coast of mainland Papua New Guinea it has a 400 year history of recorded evidence for recurring low level ash plumes, occasional Strombolian activity, lava flows, pyroclastic avalanches, and large ash plumes from Main and South, the two active summit craters. The current eruption, ongoing since June 2014, produced multiple large explosive eruptions during January September 2019, including two 15 km high ash plumes in January, repeated SO2 plumes each month, and another 15.2 km high ash plume in June that resulted in ashfall and evacuations of several thousand people BGVN 44 10 . This report covers continued activity during October 2019 through March 2020. Information about Manam is primarily provided by Papua New Guinea's Rabaul Volcano Observatory RVO , part of the Department of Mineral Policy and Geohazards Management DMPGM . This information is supplemented with aviation alerts from the Darwin Volcanic Ash Advisory Center VAAC . MODIS thermal anomaly satellite data is recorded by the University of Hawai'i's MODVOLC thermal alert recording system, and the Italian MIROVA project sulfur dioxide monitoring is done by instruments on satellites managed by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Satellite imagery provided by the Sentinel Hub Playground is also a valuable resource for information about this remote location. A few modest explosions with ash emissions were reported in early October and early November 2019, and then not again until late March 2020. Although there was little explosive activity during the period, thermal anomalies were recorded intermittently, with low to moderate activity almost every month, as seen in the MODIS data from MIROVA figure 71 and also in satellite imagery. Sulfur dioxide emissions persisted throughout the period producing emissions greater than 2.0 Dobson Units that were recorded in satellite data 3 13 days each month. The Darwin VAAC reported an ash plume in visible satellite imagery moving NW at 3.1 km altitude on 2 October 2019. Weak ash emissions were observed drifting N for the next two days along with an IR anomaly at the summit. RVO reported incandescence at night during the first week of October. Visitors to the summit on 18 October 2019 recorded steam and fumarolic activity at both of the summit craters figure 72 and recent avalanche debris on the steep slopes figure 73 . On 2 November, a single large explosion at 1330 local time produced a thick, dark ash plume that rose about 1,000 m above the summit and drifted NW. A shockwave from the explosion was felt at the Bogia Government station located 40 km SE on the mainland about 1 minute later. RVO reported an increase in seismicity on 6 November about 90 minutes before the start of a new eruption from the Main Crater which occurred between 1600 and 1630 it produced light to dark gray ash clouds that rose about 1,000 m above the summit and drifted NW. Incandescent ejecta was visible at the start of the explosion and continued with intermittent strong pulses after dark, reaching peak intensity around 1900. Activity ended by 2200 that evening. The Darwin VAAC reported a discrete emission observed in satellite imagery on 8 November that rose to 4.6 km altitude and drifted WNW, although ground observers confirmed that no eruption took place emissions were only steam and gas. There were no further reports of explosive activity until the Darwin VAAC reported an ash emission in visible satellite imagery on 20 March 2020 that rose to 3.1 km altitude and drifted E for a few hours before dissipating. Although explosive activity was minimal during the period, SO2 emissions, and evidence for continued thermal activity were recorded by satellite instruments each month. The TROPOMI instrument on the Sentinel 5P satellite captured evidence each month of SO2 emissions exceeding two Dobson Units figure 74 . The most SO2 activity occurred during October 2019, with 13 days of signatures over 2.0 DU. There were six days of elevated SO2 each month in November and December, and five days in January 2020. During February and March, activity was less, with smaller SO2 plumes recording more than 2.0 DU on three days each month. Sentinel 2 satellite imagery recorded thermal anomalies at least once from one or both of the summit craters each month between October 2019 and March 2020 figure 75 . Geologic Background. The 10 km wide island of Manam, lying 13 km off the northern coast of mainland Papua New Guinea, is one of the country's most active volcanoes. Four large radial valleys extend from the unvegetated summit of the conical 1807 m high basaltic andesitic stratovolcano to its lower flanks. These avalanche valleys channel lava flows and pyroclastic avalanches that have sometimes reached the coast. Five small satellitic centers are located near the island's shoreline on the northern, southern, and western sides. Two summit craters are present both are active, although most historical eruptions have originated from the southern crater, concentrating eruptive products during much of the past century into the SE valley. Frequent historical eruptions, typically of mild to moderate scale, have been recorded since 1616. Occasional larger eruptions have produced pyroclastic flows and lava flows that reached flat lying coastal areas and entered the sea, sometimes impacting populated areas.

" Highlights On August 14th, 8 30 a.m., an earthquake 7.2 of magnitude hit the southwestern region of Haiti with major impact in three departments South, Nippes and Grand’Anse. Estimated affected population within the broader area of earthquake impact is 1,211,000 inhabitants 66,4 considered as vulnerable in the 3 departments , including 540,000 children. Several aftershocks were recorded. A one month national state of emergency has been declared. While assessments are still in progress, thousands of houses and public buildings are partially or completely destroyed, including hospitals, schools, bridges, and churches. Preliminary assessment counted 724 deaths and 2,800 wounded people 15 Aug, 12pm although figures may rapidly raise in the coming hours. Basic social services are deeply affected with, as of August 14th, at least 1 hospital in Nippes and 3 health centers in Grand’Anse damaged, 4 schools 3 in Grand’Anse 1 in Nippes completely destroyed and 7 damaged in Nippes , according to the National Emergency Operation Center COUN . The information from the South department is yet to be confirmed. According to the Ministry of Education MENFP , further damages were reported with at least 11 schools damaged or destroyed in one commune of Grand’Anse, 5 completely destroyed in South, and 3 completely destroyed in Nippes. Fearing cracks in buildings and aftershocks, the population avoids staying inside the buildings, especially the hospitals where patients are sometimes relocated in the courtyards. Telecommunications are fragile as local services were quickly saturated. Accessibility for humanitarian response and evacuation of wounded people to the capital remains challenging as the main road leading to the affected areas is still under gangs’ control. Negotiations for the establishment of a humanitarian corridor are ongoing lead BINUH OCHA and UNHAS helicopter is available. Landslides also restrain access to certain affected areas. The National Center for Emergency Operations COUN and Departmental Centers for Emergency Operation COUD were activated and led by the DGPC Direction Générale de la Protection Civile while UNICEF is ensuring its presence and support, together with OCHA and other partners, at the national and departmental levels. Press briefings are held by the COUN under the leadership of the Prime Minister to keep the community informed. The coordination of needs assessments and response is supported at both COUN and South COUD levels by the presence of many partners, including UNICEF. A rapid damage assessment and needs analysis will be conducted on Sunday August 15th, by DGPC in the South department with UNICEF and other NGOs and agencies’ technical support. Haiti is also in the path of tropical storm Grace, which is expected to reach the country during the day and evening of Monday 16th August.","['Earthquake', 'Tropical Cyclone']"

"CROP AND FOOD SUPPLY SITUATION br b OVERVIEW b p As of November 2002, the number of countries facing serious food difficulties throughout the world stands at 39, with 25 in Africa, 6 in Asia, 6 in Latin America and 2 in Europe. p In b southern Africa b , the difficult food supply situation, as a result of two poor harvests in a row, continues to tighten with dwindling food stocks and slow imports. The food situation is particularly critical in Zimbabwe where serious food shortages are affecting half of the population. Food assistance to the neediest is inadequate and slow in coming, while commercial imports are hampered by the worsening economic crisis. Out of the 14.4 million people severely at risk and in need of food assistance in southern Africa, WFP has requested 993 000 tonnes of food aid to assist 10.3 million of the worst affected people until March 2003. Against this requirement, pledges by early November amounted to some 637 000 tonnes. While food aid distributions in the sub region speeded up in October, they remained well below target in Zimbabwe due to insufficient contributions, and in Zambia where the Government's refusal of GM grain has resulted in delays in distributions. There is urgent need for additional food aid pledges and for expediting delivery of contracted commercial imports to avoid a rapid deterioration of the food situation. Planting of the 2003 cereal crops has started, and prospects are favourable so far, reflecting generally abundant precipitation since the second dekad of October. However, unseasonably dry weather prevails in Malawi and northern parts of Zambia. p In b the Great Lakes region b , prospects for the 2003 first season crops are poor in Burundi and Rwanda reflecting below average precipitation in September and October. Production is anticipated to be reduced in many areas. In Burundi, the impact of dry weather is being compounded by a deterioration in the security situation, resulting in increased numbers of people in need of emergency food assistance. In the Democratic Republic of Congo the food and nutritional condition has further worsened as a result of renewed fighting and massive population displacement. p In b eastern Africa b , serious food shortages have emerged in several parts mainly due to drought conditions, with increasing numbers in need of food assistance. p In Eritrea, the food situation is serious due to the failure of the short quot azmera quot rains and inadequate long quot kiremti quot rains. The Government of Eritrea has appealed for emergency food assistance for about 1.4 million people. In Ethiopia, poor secondary season quot belg quot rains and a late start and early cessation of the current main quot meher quot season rains have created an alarming food situation. Large numbers of livestock have died and unusual migrations in search of water and pasture are reported in several parts of the country. In response, the Government has recently appealed to the international community for food assistance for about 6 million people. In Kenya, the current maize harvest in major producing provinces has improved the overall food supply situation. However, despite recent beneficial rains the food supply situation is of concern in the districts of Mandera, Turkana, Samburu, Marsabit, West Pokot and Baringo. In Sudan, crop prospects are unfavourable due to delayed onset of rains and population displacement in the south following recent escalation of the long running conflict. In Somalia, despite the current good secondary quot deyr quot season rains and the favourable outturn of the main season quot gu quot crops, harvested last August, continuing insecurity and escalation of conflict in parts with attendant population displacement are cause for serious concern. In Uganda, despite an overall stable food supply situation, erratic rains in parts and recent population displacements in the north pose serious food problems in the affected areas. In Tanzania, the recent good harvests from the main season crops have improved overall food availability. p In b central Africa b , in the Central African Republic, harvest prospects are uncertain following erratic and below average rains affecting crop development in some regions. A resurgence of fighting in the capital city, Bangui, has displaced a large number of its residents. p In b northern Africa b , planting of the winter wheat and coarse grains has started for the spring 2003 harvest. Aggregate cereal output in 2002 was 28 million tonnes, slightly below the output in 2001 but above the past 5 year average of about 26.7 million tonnes. Significant increases have been registered in Egypt and Morocco. In Algeria and Tunisia, by contrast, production of wheat and coarse grains declined considerably from 2001 levels, mainly as a result of dry weather at planting and during the development period. p In b west Africa b , the performance of the 2002 cereal harvest in the Sahel is mixed. Following the first rains in June, a long dry spell from early July through August severely affected crops in Cape Verde, The Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Mauritania and Senegal. Production of rainfed crops fell sharply, although rainfall in August reduced losses somewhat. In the eastern and central parts of the Sahel the main producing countries by contrast, growing conditions were more favourable, despite an erratic start of the rainy season which necessitated replantings. A series of joint FAO CILSS Crop Assessment Missions in the 9 CILSS member countries of the Sahel in October estimated aggregate 2002 cereal production at 11.3 million tonnes, 3 percent lower than 2001 but 11 percent above average. Below average harvests are anticipated in Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau and Mauritania while near average production is expected in Chad, the Gambia, Mali and Senegal. Above average outputs are foreseen in Burkina Faso and Niger. In the coastal countries along the Gulf of Guinea, harvest prospects are generally favourable in Benin, Nigeria and Togo but less favourable in Ghana, following below normal rains in September and October. In Liberia, agricultural activities have been disrupted by renewed civil strife, pointing to reduced rice production this year. In Côte d'Ivoire, a reduction in rice and other cereal production is forecast as a result of unfavourable weather and conflicts that forced many farmers to leave their land. p In b Asia b , the early outlook is generally favourable for the largely irrigated cereal crops being planted now for harvest in 2003. By contrast, the outcome of the main season harvest, which has been completed in most countries, was affected by an erratic 2002 monsoon and other irregular weather developments. In a number of countries, this resulted in below average cereal outputs and consequent food shortages, while in other countries bumper crops were reaped. Thus, in DPR Korea, an FAO WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission in October concluded that despite an improvement in cereal production, domestic food supplies continue to fall short of demand and have to be supplemented by cereal imports. Taking into account commercial imports, the food aid requirement for 2002 03 is estimated at 0.98 million tonnes of cereals. Donor pledges are urgently needed to cover the WFP emergency operation for the remainder of 2002 and the first quarter of 2003. In Mongolia, less than 50 percent of normal precipitation and scorching temperatures in the summer of 2002 seriously affected both cereal and livestock production aggravating the food situation of the already disaster hit agricultural population. Food relief will be necessary to meet the shortfall in supplies. p In the b Near East b , favourable weather conditions in most countries have boosted domestic food production. In Afghanistan agricultural production has recovered strongly, reducing cereal import requirements by more than a third compared to the previous two years. Funding shortfalls in the face of massive return of refugees give cause for serious concern. Investment in the agricultural sector, particularly in the rehabilitation, upgrading and maintenance of the irrigation infrastructure will be essential for speedy recovery of the Afghan economy. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, torrential rains in August triggered flash floods and landslides in north eastern provinces, affecting 100 000 people and causing 37 deaths. The food situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip is grave due to the continuing confinement of families in homes by curfews and military operations. p In the b Asian CIS b , cereal harvests this year have sharply recovered owing mainly to improved precipitation and relatively better growing conditions. Cereal harvests in the Kyrghyz Republic, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Armenia have significantly improved. However, food supply in Tajikistan and Georgia remains rather tight. p In b Central America b , the outlook is favourable for the 2002 03 second season cereal and bean crops. Harvesting is underway and average maize outputs are expected in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, while in Nicaragua an above average output is expected. The food supply situation continues to be tight, however, in certain localized communities of the sub region, particularly those affected by the crisis in the coffee sector. Plantations in many areas have been forced to close and thousands of workers were left unemployed. Food assistance from the international community is being distributed to the most affected families. In the Caribbean, the passage of hurricanes quot Isidore quot and quot Lili quot in Cuba and Jamaica, at the end of September and first days of October, inflicted considerable damage to important cash crops, such as citrus, tobacco and sugar, as well as to rural housing and infrastructure. In Haiti, seasonal rains are benefiting planting of the second season coarse grain and bean crops. The crops had been adversely affected by dry weather, particularly in the north west, earlier in the year. In the southern departments of the country, food assistance is being provided to farmers affected by adverse weather at planting and during the growing season. p In b South America b , harvesting of the 2002 wheat crop and planting of the 2002 03 first season coarse grain crops is underway in the southern areas of the sub region. Growing conditions are generally favourable. In Paraguay, by contrast, a prolonged drought is affecting the western departments, and a state of emergency has been declared by the government which has appealed for emergency assistance, including food aid. In the Andean countries, in Peru, production of wheat and maize outputs in 2002 is provisionally estimated at well above average levels. A bumper paddy crop has also been harvested. In Ecuador, a series of volcano eruptions in October and early November affected crops and pastures. However, maize output has been above average. p In b Europe b , aggregate 2002 cereal production in the EU is estimated to rise to about 212 million tonnes, 5 percent up from last year, after sharply increased wheat crops several major producing countries. The estimate of aggregate coarse grain production remains at about 105 million tonnes, about 2 percent down from last year. Winter grain planting is underway in northern parts of the EU under generally satisfactory weather conditions. In eastern Europe, wheat production has dropped sharply in Hungary and Romania but elsewhere outputs are similar to last year's levels. Widespread autumn rains have improved soil moisture conditions throughout the region for the germinating winter grains. p In the European b CIS b , cereal harvest in 2002 03 marketing year is expected to nearly match the bumper harvest of the preceding year. In Russia cereal harvest this year includes 47.5 million tonnes of wheat and 35.3 million tonnes of coarse grains, which respectively compare with 46.9 million tonnes and 35.9 million tonnes in 2001 02 marketing year. Cereal harvest in Ukraine includes some 21 million tonnes of wheat and 15.9 million tonnes of coarse grains, which compares with 21.3 million tonnes of wheat and some15.9 million tonnes of coarse grains in the 2001 02 marketing year. p In the b Balkans b , cereal harvest is estimated to nearly match the sharply recovered harvest of the preceding year. Torrential floods and hail, which normally damage spring crops, did not have any significant impact on crops this year. p In b North America b , the latest official estimates put the 2002 wheat output in the United States at about 44 million tonnes, 17 percent down from the already reduced crop in 2001. With the bulk of the coarse grain crop harvested by the end of October, the latest forecast of aggregate coarse grain output in the United States stands at about 246 million tonnes.6.5 percent down from last year. The bulk of the winter wheat crop for harvest in 2003 was planted by the end of October, the overall rate of planting and emergence being slightly ahead of the normal for that time of year. The condition of emerging crops is reported to be on the whole better than at the same time last year. In Canada, output of cereals in 2002 has fallen sharply following severe drought in parts of the country. Output of wheat is officially estimated at 15.5 million tonnes, about 25 percent down from last year while that of coarse grains is put at 19.8 million tonnes, 13 percent down from 2001. p In b Oceania b , the winter grain harvest is getting underway in Australia, where this year's crops have been severely affected by drought. Wheat output is forecast at about 10.1 million tonnes, 58 percent below the previous year's near record crop. The winter barley crop is likewise expected to fall sharply. Good rainfall is needed in the coming weeks for planting in the main summer crop areas. In Papua New Guinea, a severe drought activity in West New Britain province has forced people out of their villages. p pdf format, 671 KB .","['Cold Wave', 'Drought', 'Earthquake', 'Extratropical Cyclone', 'Flood', 'Tropical Cyclone']"

"GENEVA 3 August 2015 – The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the human rights of internally displaced persons, Chaloka Beyani, has urged the Government of the Philippines to follow through with its commitments and devote much needed attention and resources to internally displaced persons “until durable solutions are attained and their futures are secured.” Mr. Beyani’s call comes at the end of his official ten day visit to the Philippines, where he assessed the impact of all forms of internal displacement, including those caused by disasters, armed conflict, and development projects on the ancestral lands of indigenous peoples. The UN expert praised the Government for its responses to the massive internal displacement caused by Typhoon Haiyan. However, he expressed concern that “attention and resources appear to be waning before durable solutions are achieved and some IDPs remain in dire situations.” He travelled to Tacloban in the Visayas which had been affected by Haiyan known locally as ‘Yolanda’ which made landfall in November 2013 killing some 6,300 in the Philippines and displacing hundreds of thousands from their homes. The Special Rapporteur welcomed significant progress in providing transitional and permanent homes to those affected and restoring livelihood opportunities, as well as policies such as ‘Build Back Better’ aimed at mitigating against the effects of future disasters. Nevertheless the expert expressed surprise that, despite huge resources spent or earmarked for infrastructure projects, for many displaced communities basic service provision, including water, sanitation and electricity are lacking almost two years after Haiyan. Some families “seem to have become stuck in substandard ‘bunkhouse’ accommodation or fallen entirely through the protection net,” he commented. Mr. Beyani urged the Government to rapidly take concrete steps to resolve problems affecting IDPs, including to adopt what would be a landmark law on the rights of internally displaced persons following more than a decade of deliberation. “An ‘almost law’ is as good as no law at all,” the UN expert stated. “For a country prone to disasters and the displacement effects of long standing conflicts it is essential to enshrine the rights and protection of IDPs into law. Not to do so after a decade of debate sends a wrong signal about the Government’s commitment to ensuring respect for their rights and withholds essential legal protection from IDPs.” Mr Beyani visited other regions of the country affected by displacement caused by the long standing conflicts with non State armed groups in various regions of Mindanao. He urged intensified efforts to achieve inclusive and lasting peace as an essential means of ending the conflicts which have displaced millions over the last four decades. “Conflict, militarization and displacement have become the common pattern in some localities and responses to conflict driven displacement crisis need to be more effective in some areas where they have gone from poor to almost non existent,” Mr. Beyani said. “Armed conflict or intrusive development projects not only displace indigenous peoples and subject them to conditions that may bring about their destruction as peoples, they also destroy their homes and livelihoods,” noted the rights expert, who also visited Tampakan, where a proposed open pit gold and copper mine will potentially displace over 5000 people, the majority of whom are indigenous peoples. “They have an incalculable impact on their cultures and ways of life that are part of the rich and diverse heritage of the Philippines that must be protected or otherwise lost, perhaps forever,” he stressed. “Indigenous peoples struggle to survive away from their ancestral lands and require special protection including through the full implementation of the Indigenous Peoples’ Rights Act.” The Special Rapporteur thanked the Government for its cooperation with his mandate and is committed to continuing his constructive engagement with national authorities. He will produce a full report and recommendations based on his visit to be presented to the Government of the Philippines and the UN Human Rights Council in 2016.

"WRITTEN BY GARY EDMONDS In over thirty years of traveling around the world and learning about solutions to end poverty, the question that seems to be the most important one to ask is this are these solutions sustainable? Sustainable Change Leads to Lasting Impact While I care about all the different ways that help to eliminate poverty in the most vulnerable places in the world, I want to make sure that efforts are done with respect and dignity with those who are meant to benefit from them. Our efforts should make a quantifiable difference in the lives of the poor, so they may thrive and bless others. So, I cannot simply stop with the question, “Are we making an impact?” The more important question is, “Are we making a sustainable, lasting impact?” I kept this question front of mind during a past trip to Samar, Philippines. Following Typhoon Haiyan’s https www.fh.org 2013 11 12 update typhoon haiyan survivors need help devastation in 2013, I wanted to see how the Filipino people had responded to this disaster. And I wanted to find out if their solutions were making a sustainable impact. In short and generally speaking, the communities FH has walked with since Typhoon Haiyan are now thriving! https www.fh.org 2014 11 18 typhoon haiyan year later But why? It’s very challenging for a community to revitalize physically and spiritually so soon after a cataclysmic disaster. In my experience, this process typically can take years! So, what element of the relief effort made this situation unique? One answer was vividly apparent to me. Community Owned Transformation From the moment FH entered the community of Basey, we saw how committed the community was to their self penned rallying cry, “Better than before.” We were also astonished to see how they were taking responsibility to make change happen. The community knew it wasn’t Food for the Hungry FH staff who would bring about lasting sustainable transformation. It wouldn’t be outside organizations or the government who would piece their lives back together. They had the power within themselves, as a community and with God’s help, to become “better than before.” Over the next few days we saw countless examples of this… One day we attended a “hand over” ceremony of a community health center. FH helped the community connect into the government health network. Then, they began to host weekly clinics and health consultations. With relief funds, a small clinic was opened and is now providing critical health assistance to a community that never had it before. We visited a co op of pedicab drivers who received livelihood training from FH. They are now pooling their resources to set up a garage for repairs and to store tools and parts. This efficiency has allowed them to increase profits and provide safer transportation within the community. I was thrilled to hear about FH staff training families on how to set up rainwater collection systems https www.fh.org products rainwater collection tank . These systems collect rainwater off the roofs of homes. The water is then saved for cleaning and bathing. FH then helped broker a deal with the local government, so that families could be contracted out by the local government to install rainwater catchment systems throughout the region, after given training. We met several community based savings groups http blog.fh.org 2014 03 little savings saves many that were receiving FH trainings on how to organize and pool their savings. This allows them to grant small business loans within their community. This is a proven method to build the earning potential of a community without giving handouts or a monetary investment. The common thread of all these examples is that the community is owning their transformation. They are in the driver’s seat and taking control of their future. I see FH as the Driver’s Ed instructor. We offer suggestions and guidance, but ultimately we are along for the ride with the intent to exit the car. Planning Our Exit At FH, we plan our exit strategy. It is thrilling to see communities take control of their future. It is evident that in order to make a sustainable difference in the lives of the most vulnerable, we must support and promote community ownership of both the problems they face and solutions to them. If we are serious about ending poverty together https www.fh.org our work , then we should all champion the slogan “better than before” — together.","['Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Storm Surge', 'Tropical Cyclone']"

" Responding to the devastating consequences of the earthquake, ECW investment will be deployed by UNICEF and World Food Programme to reach 18,000 children 17 September 2021, New York Education Cannot Wait announced today a new US 1.5 million first emergency response grant in Haiti. The grant will be deployed in coordination with the Government of Haiti, by UNICEF https www.unicef.org topics haiti , the World Food Programme https www.wfp.org countries haiti and both international and local civil society, reaching 18,000 children impacted by the 7.2 magnitude earthquake, which caused massive destruction and exacerbated pressing needs for children and youth already impacted by COVID 19, civil unrest and other crises. The death toll from the 14 August quake has surpassed 2,200, affecting at least a quarter of a million children that are now in need of emergency humanitarian assistance after losing homes, schools and other basic services. Prior to the quake, 2.2 million Haitian children were already in need of humanitarian assistance. Preliminary assessments indicate extensive damage and destruction across schools, just weeks before they are due to re open for the start of the school year. Reports from the three most affected departments cite the total destruction or severe damage to over 300 school buildings, affecting an estimated 100,000 children and teachers. To support the people of Haiti in building back better, ECW and partners are currently formulating a multi year resilience programme in Haiti that will bridge the humanitarian development nexus and build on the impact of this First Emergency Response. The LEGO Foundation https www.legofoundation.com en about us news the lego foundation and kirkbi announce 100mdkk grant to support vulnerable children in haiti and afghanistan and KIRKBI https www.kirkbi.com , the owners of the LEGO Group, announced US 5 million https www.educationcannotwait.org lego foundation funding in new funding to support ECW's First Emergency Response in Afghanistan and Haiti in late August. Governments and private sector need to step up to fully fund the education in emergency response in Haiti. Children and adolescents have lost loved ones, they have lost their homes, and they have had their education suddenly disrupted. Their safety and hope for the future are now lost, as these girls and boys face hunger, violence, sexual abuse and exploitation, child trafficking and early pregnancy. Together with our partners, we are responding with speed to ensure no child is left behind, but we urgently need more resources, said Yasmine Sherif, Director of Education Cannot Wait, the United Nations global fund for education in emergencies. Children bear the brunt of natural disasters worldwide. Haitian children have given much more. They have been turned away for so long from classrooms by social unrest, COVID 19 secondary effects and gang related violence at a time. Now children in southwestern Haiti have survived a devastating earthquake that cost them parents, siblings, health centers and schools. Along with their teachers who are not better off, they need didactic, learning and psychosocial support. This support from ECW has come at the right time and will allow us to help stabilize Haitian children's lives for a new beginning, said Bruno Maes, UNICEF Haiti Representative. I'd like to thank ECW for this critical funding working with our partner UNICEF to offer a complementary package of activities in the areas most hard hit by the earthquake. In support of reconstruction and recovery efforts led by the Haitian authorities, WFP will provide thousands of children with much needed food assistance to help accelerate the reopening of schools, said Pierre Honnorat, WFP Country Director in Haiti. The ECW supported 12 month First Emergency Response will contribute to provide safe and inclusive temporary learning spaces with basic learning materials to 1,400 girls, boys and adolescents in an inclusive and gender responsive manner. It will also include the provision of basic water, sanitation and hygiene services as well as school feeding for 13,000 children. Cash transfers will be provided for the most marginalized children and their families, as well as mental health and psychosocial support. Marginalized out of school adolescents will be provided with non formal education. Trainings in psychosocial support and psychological first aid, as well as protection issues, including gender based violence risk mitigation and safe referrals will also be provided to 100 teachers, and 5,000 children and adolescents will be sensitized on protection issues and referral to available services. The grantees and implementing partners will coordinate with provincial authorities to ensure child safeguarding standards as well as provide awareness raising on prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse, violence against children and gender based violence.",['Earthquake']

" Download photos and multimedia, here https weshare.unicef.org Package 2AMZIFH9NDJ4 PORT AU PRINCE PANAMA NEW YORK, 18 August 2021 Preliminary assessments conducted Tuesday by UNICEF and Haitian officials in one of the three departments hardest hit by Saturday's earthquake, followed by Tropical Depression Grace on Monday, revealed extensive destruction to schools, just weeks before they are due to re open. Initial estimates show that 94 of the 255 schools in South Department are completely destroyed or have sustained partial damages. Assessments have yet to take place in Nippes and Grand'Anse departments, as well as other communities that have yet to be reached. It will be extremely difficult for parents, teachers and the government to get children safely back to school just three weeks from now, when schools re open on September 7, said Bruno Maes, UNICEF's Representative in Haiti, after visiting a damaged school in Mazenod, near Les Cayes. But it is so crucial for children who have just gone through this traumatic earthquake plus extreme weather experience, to have the normalcy and stability of being in a classroom with their friends and teachers. The official tally of deaths and destruction is still growing. As of late Tuesday, at least 1,941 people had been killed and over 9,900 injured. Over 115,000 houses had been damaged or destroyed, and nearly 580,000 people, or about 40 per cent of the population in the three departments, were in need of emergency assistance. The latest calamity comes on top of two years that saw children out of school for months at a time due to political or security challenges and the COVID 19 pandemic, Maes said. Haiti's children need solidarity and support. Parents and teachers who have lost everything will need support. And we will need resources to rebuild some schools, rehabilitate others, equip classes with desks, teachers and students with pedagogical and school kits. Putting children back in classrooms is perhaps the best way to make sure they and their families and communities can recover. UNICEF is rushing life saving supplies including medicine, safe water, hygiene and sanitation material, and tarpaulins, to the affected areas, even as flooding and mudslides hamper relief efforts. UNICEF estimates that it will need US 15 million to respond to the most urgent needs of at least 385,000 people including 167,000 children under the age of five for a period of eight weeks. This initial funding requirement will be reviewed and adjusted in the coming weeks as the impact on children and families becomes clearer.",['Earthquake']

" Don’t forget the disadvantaged, says a new GEM Report urging countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to promote inclusion in education in the face of COVID 19 A new GEM Regional report in partnership with SUMMA shows that COVID 19 has increased education divides in Latin America and the Caribbean, which was already the most unequal region in the world before the pandemic began. Although the report acknowledges the efforts made by countries to continue distance learning programmes, it points to the need to develop urgent measures to reach those left behind. Its recommendations show steps policy makers most prioritise in their response plans so that the education emergency does not turn into a disaster. The Report, Todos y todas sin excepción , produced by the Global Education Monitoring GEM Report and the Regional Bureau for Education in Latin America and the Caribbean OREALC UNESCO Santiago https es.unesco.org fieldoffice santiago , along with the Laboratory of Education, Research and Innovation in Latin America and the Caribbean SUMMA shows that, prior to the pandemic, in 21 countries, children from the richest households were five times as likely as the poorest to complete upper secondary school. Learning outcomes were low before COVID 19. Only half of 15 year olds achieved minimum proficiency in reading. In Guatemala and Panama , barely 10 disadvantaged 15 year old students master basic mathematics skills for every 100 of their better off peers. Indigenous people and Afro descendants also have lower attainment and literacy rates. In grade 3, students who do not speak the language of the test are less likely to reach a minimum level of proficiency in reading. The probability of Afro descendants completing secondary education was 14 lower than that of non Afro descendants in Peru and 24 lower in Uruguay in 2015. Adolescents with disabilities were on average 10 percentage points less likely to attend school than their peers. The education systems in the region are not only characterized by low quality, but also by high levels of inequality and social exclusion. This problem has been exacerbated by the pandemic. For this reason, we must urgently invest and reform our education systems to develop their capacity to adapt to the particular needs of their students and territories, recognizing, valuing and building on diversity, as an essential and constitutive element of educational quality. Javier González, Director at SUMMA The report includes a set of key recommendations for the next decade, which will help countries achieve the objectives of the 2030 Agenda and calls for schools to be more inclusive , which many still are not. A survey of 10 of schools in Jamaica showed only 24 had ramps and 11 had accessible bathrooms. Bullying urgently needs to be addressed LGBTI youth in seven countries being heavily victimized were at least two times as likely to miss school. Now more than ever Latin American societies need to come together as a society and build bridges. What all of us think and uphold matters. Everyday discrimination against migrants, backlashes against progress for gender equality, identity and expression, and false beliefs about the ceiling of potential for people with disabilities end up reflected in education systems. Change is urgently needed, but it won’t happen unless we all sign up. Manos Antoninis, Director of the GEM Report Better data is needed on those left behind. In the Caribbean, only 4 of 21 countries have had a publicly available household survey since 2015 to disaggregate education indicators by individual characteristics. The Dominican Republic was the only country in the Caribbean to participate in a cross national learning assessment in the same period. Training teachers to teach inclusively is also critical. In Brazil, Colombia and Mexico over half of teachers reported a high need for training on teaching students with special needs. Claudia Uribe, Director of OREALC said “There is the expectation that teachers have strategies to compensate for these disadvantages, but it is difficult to do so if they do not have the tools and training to do so. Two thirds of countries say they will train teachers on inclusion in the region, but data indicates that this is not yet the case in practice. Our Report urges countries to pay greater attention to this”. Curricula and textbooks must represent all groups are fairly, and respectfully. Textbooks in various countries tend to present indigenous peoples in stereotyped images and situations, when they are represented at all. Educational support is often not provided in the home language, affecting children from indigenous communities, children and young people of Haitian origin who have migrated to Spanish or English speaking countries, and children whose mother tongue is different from the official language of the school, as is typically the case in Caribbean countries. In Suriname , for example, only 4 of children in Sipaliwini district speak the language of instruction, Dutch, at home. The Report shows that the region is often an example of strong laws and policies that express a will for change, but calls for these to be more adequately implemented. The analysis of the PEER educational profiles https education profiles.org of each country in the world from the GEM Report on Inclusion shows that 10 of the 19 countries in the world that adopt inclusion for all in their educational laws are in Latin America and the Caribbean. However, although the laws in only 42 of the countries in the region provide for the education of persons with disabilities in separate settings, not many ordinary primary schools serve students with disabilities. In Nicaragua , for example, a third of the approximately 10,000 students with disabilities studied in special schools in 2019. In countries such as Trinidad and Tobago , among others, regulations have not yet been established to guarantee the right to education of refugee boys and girls and migrants from Venezuela, which has led national and international civil society actors to work together to meet their needs. The Report has ten recommendations in total, backed up with evidence based examples from across the region and invites countries to take them into account in their plans for action in the decade for action until 2030 and to prevent education progress backsliding as a result of COVID 19. The Report is the focus of a 2020 Regional Forum on Education Policy – Inclusion and Education in Post Pandemic Times, 9 12 November with ministry officials and experts in education from across the region. This platform for exchange is co organised by the UNESCO International Institute for Educational Planning IIEP , the GEM Report, OREALC UNESCO Santiago, the UNESCO Institute for Statistics UIS and the UNESCO Division of Education 2030 Support and Coordination. The forum will provide a space for policy makers to develop concrete actions for developing policies to mitigate exclusion in the region.

"By LAWI WENG THE IRRAWADDY The International Labor Organization ILO in Rangoon said on Tuesday that it is cooperating with both the Burmese government and the Kachin Independence Army KIA in working for the release of underage Burmese soldiers currently detained by the Kachin rebels. The announcement comes just two days after the ILO confirmed that the Burmese army had itself released 42 underage soldiers. Steve Marshall, the ILO liaison officer in Rangoon, told The Irrawaddy that his organization had received information about some 40 Burmese soldiers who were effectively being held as prisoners of war by the KIA. “Some, we understand, are allegedly underage recruits or child soldiers,” he said. “We received some data about those people and we are now working with the government of Myanmar Burma to identity these kids and verify the situation, so we can actually negotiate their discharge. “We have to work together with the government, with the KIA, and also with the society, so that these young people are able to return to their families, to be reintegrated into normal society. “It is obviously a sensitive issue. I have to say that we are hopeful the government and the KIA will approve this on the basis of the rights of the child, and not look at the political method.” KIA spokesman La Nan told The Irrawaddy on Wednesday that the Kachin army wished to release the detainees, and were cooperating. He said the KIA had already sent a list of names of detainees to the ILO. It is believed the 40 detainees are currently being held in Laiza, the headquarters of the Kachin rebels. According to La Nan, some of the detainees are aged 15 or 16, while others are 19 to 20. He said that the ILO is free to ascertain who is underage when they visit the KIA headquarters. The captives were seized by the Kachin rebels during various battles in Burma’s restive north. La Nan said the detainees fear returning to their families because they may be re arrested by Burmese military officials. The ILO has been working with the Burmese government on a joint UN task force—headed by UNICEF and including international NGOs World Vision and Save the Children—for the release and reintegration of child soldiers and the prevention of further recruitment. Human rights groups including the UN have long accused both the Burmese armed forces and various ethnic rebel armies of recruiting underage soldiers during decades of civil war in the Southeast Asian nation. Eight groups were singled out by the UN Secretary General and accused of using child soldiers—the Burmese Army, the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army, the Kachin Independence Army, Karen National Liberation Army, Karen National Liberation Army Peace Council, Karenni Army, Shan State Army South, and the United Wa State Army.",['Snow Avalanche']

" Highlights With the increasing risk of COVID 19, key preventive messages were integrated in multi sectoral activities. The key interventions implemented during the reporting period includes training of social mobilisers, community influencers and cluster partners. Following the Government of South Sudan’s closure of schools and educational institutions, approximately 2 million children, currently enrolled in primary and secondary levels, will be deprived of attending schools. The Education Cluster partners have taken steps to explore strategies to help manage and mitigate the impact of COVID 19. UNICEF conducted orientation for 52 implementing partners and health care workers on risk communication, infection prevention and control and integration of health services in the context of the COVID 19 response. Funding Overview and Partnerships UNICEF appeals for US 180 million to sustain the provision of life saving services for women and children in South Sudan. UNICEF expresses its sincere gratitude to all public and private donors for the contributions received, however, the 2020 HAC still has a funding gap of 61 . Without adequate funding, UNICEF and partners will be unable to scale up integrated programming and provide critical and protective services for women, children and men displaced by conflict, affected by gender based violence, facing the risk of disease outbreaks including COVID 19 , and impacted by extreme food insecurity. Situation Overview Humanitarian Needs The already complex operating environment in South Sudan will only become more challenging with an outbreak of COVID 19. Despite the suspension of entry via airports and border crossings, at least 12,000 people entered the country through informal crossings from known outbreak areas in neighbouring countries, making an outbreak highly likely. Given existing vulnerabilities – including high malnutrition, a weak health system and dense population displacement sites like the Protection of Civilian Sites PoCs – the impact of COVID 19 could be severe. This would also likely hamper the peace process , as it has already led to a suspension of some security arrangements and caused further delays in appointing sub national authorities. Additional restrictions to prevent and contain an outbreak will also hinder UNICEF and partner’s ability to respond. Suspension of domestic flights and inter state movements would largely prevent the movement of staff and assistance to women and children in need. Such measures would compound existing access challenges, including insecurity, inter communal violence, criminality, attacks against humanitarians, and bureaucratic impediments.","['Drought', 'Epidemic']"
"UNDER SECRETARY GENERAL ROSEMARY A. DICARLO REMARKS TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL ON UKRAINE New York, 16 NOVEMBER 2022 Mr President, In the past few days, Ukrainians have been subjected to some of the most intense bombardments of the nine month old war. Russian missiles and drones have rained down on Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Kharkiv, Lviv, Poltava and elsewhere, destroying or damaging homes and severely disrupting critical services. The impact of such attacks can only worsen during the coming winter months. As of 14 November, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights OHCHR has recorded 16,631 civilian casualties 6,557 persons killed and 10,074 injured since the start of the full scale invasion of Ukraine. The recent barrages will alas add to horrific toll the war has already taken. I must say it again attacks targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure are prohibited under international humanitarian law. The military dynamics on the ground continue to evolve. In the past week, the city of Kherson returned to Ukrainian Government control. Heavy battles also continue in Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Indeed, there is no end in sight to the war. As long as it continues, the risks of potentially catastrophic spillover remain all too real. Yesterday’s incident in Poland near the Ukrainian border was a frightening reminder of the absolute need to prevent any further escalation. I wish to join the Secretary General in extending condolences to the families of the two Polish civilians killed in the incident. Mr. President, The ongoing bombardment of Ukraine has already damaged an estimated 40 per cent of the country’s power generation capacity. Kyiv has been hit hardest. Most parts of the capital are now without electricity for 12 hours a day. As the Ukrainian Government focuses on repairing damaged infrastructure, the United Nations has made it a priority to ensure that the most vulnerable receive winter supplies and services. More than 185,000 people have already received essential basic winter supplies. Humanitarian partners are setting up “heating points” near the front lines. Some 525 generators were provided or are being distributed, to priority institutions, including hospitals, collective centers, clinics. Humanitarian access has resumed in the areas back under Ukrainian Government control, including in Kherson. However, it is still extremely difficult to reach people in need in areas of the east and south under the control of the Russian military and across the front line. Mine contamination particularly in areas close to the front or where control has recently shifted – are putting more lives at risk, impeding the movement of civilians and hampering humanitarian efforts. I remind the parties that international humanitarian law requires them to facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for all civilians in need. Mr. President, The allegations of atrocities and human rights violations in Ukraine during this war are extensive. Today I would like to highlight grave concerns about the rights, safety and security of the youngest Ukrainians. Over 400 children have been killed, and many more have been injured, lost their family members, or been forced to leave their homes. According to the Government portal “Children of War,” 279 children were considered missing as of 12 November. There are also disturbing reports of forced transfers of children, including of some under institutionalized care to Russian occupied territory, or to the Russian Federation. OHCHR has documented several individual cases, including of unaccompanied children, that appear to amount to deportations to the Russian Federation – in violation of international humanitarian law. OHCHR also continues to document other types of human rights violations, including 57 verified cases of conflict related sexual violence. Forty eight of these cases are attributable to Russian armed forces and affiliated groups nine are attributable to Ukrainian armed forces and law enforcement authorities. The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine continues its work towards accountability for alleged violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law with ongoing investigations in and out of Ukraine. The Commissioners are planning another visit to Ukraine before the end of the year. Another issue of concern is the conditions of prisoners of war. I welcome the continued prisoner exchanges between Russia and Ukraine, including most recently on 11 November. We encourage the sides to continue releasing POWs. I call on the parties to ensure humane treatment of prisoners of war, in line with their obligations under international law, in particular, the Third Geneva Convention. I also call on the Russian Federation to grant OHCHR and ICRC unimpeded access to detainees. Mr. President, The extension of the Black Sea Grain Initiative remains vital to help avert a food crisis for millions of people. More than 10 million metric tons of foodstuffs have now been moved under the Initiative, reaching, or on the way to, some 40 countries. The impact of the Initiative extends far beyond immediate ports of arrival, helping to lower global prices for key food commodities around the world. The Secretary General has continued his engagement with all parties in support of the renewal and full implementation of the Initiative. He has also emphasized his commitment to removing remaining obstacles to Russian food and fertilizer exports. These products are not under international sanctions but suffer indirect impacts. It is important and critical to get them back to world markets – the sooner, the better. Mr. President, The risk of a nuclear incident in the context of the open hostilities in Ukraine remains an unacceptable danger. I wish to echo the serious concerns expressed by numerous Member States in this regard. The IAEA Director General has recently briefed this Council on the organization’s latest efforts, including ongoing discussions regarding the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant as well as assessments of activities and materials at other sites in Ukraine. The IAEA has reported that, in the coming weeks, it will send nuclear safety and security missions to three more operating nuclear power plants, as well as to Chernobyl, at the request of the Ukrainian Government. I reiterate the imperative to avoid any military activity that could risk compromising the safety and security of any nuclear facility. Mr. President, Since before the invasion of 24 February, the United Nations and many others in the global community warned of the consequences of a wider war in Ukraine, for Ukrainians, first of all, but also for much of the world. Those fears have amply borne out. One significant casualty of the war has been the international collective security system we have all pledged to uphold. The damage to the structures built to resolve or manage tensions and conflict is significant, making it, in turn, even more difficult to chart a path out of the hostilities in Ukraine. There is only one way to stop the death, destruction and division. The war must end. And it must end in line with international law and the UN Charter, as called for by the UN General Assembly.",['Technological Disaster']
" Highlights Tensions increase in the Gaza Strip, due to the slow path of the reconstruction process, the impact of the winter storm on IDPs and in general the protraction of overall insecurity, including power and water shortages and unsafe living conditions for the people affected by the war. Test of rockets continue as well as ground incursions into the Gaza territory and warning fire by IDF to the fishermen off the Gaza shore. No injured reported. On 27 January, UNRWA announced that due to funding shortfalls, the agency was suspending its cash assistance programme in Gaza for repairs to damaged and destroyed homes and for rental subsidies to the homeless. Some demonstrations of protest were held on 28 January in front of the UNSCO and UNRWA compounds, with reportedly some demonstrators irrupting into the UNSCO compound and provoking some damages to it. As reported to the Security Council, the situation in Gaza has become extremely volatile again and will continue to deteriorate unless a number of critical underlying issues are addressed with both determination and a heightened sense of urgency. The United Nations Country Team continue to urge donors to support humanitarian operations and fulfil the commitments they have made in Cairo for the reconstruction of Gaza. At regional level, the situation experienced some peaks of tensions with an exchange of fire between IDF and Hezbollah in the Golan and Sheba Farm region. An escalation of hostilities at the border between Lebanon and Israel could seriously affect the already vulnerable security situation in the Gaza Strip, The number of IDPs in UNRWA Collective Centers stands at 10,568. On 22 January UNICEF and the Ministry of Social Affairs MoSA distributed blankets and warm clothing, to 253 highly vulnerable and needy families across Gaza as part of the UNICEF Gaza Winterization support aiming at reaching vulnerable families as per needs.

" Humanitarian Situation and Needs 291,171 people have been displaced by floods since beginning of the long rains and many have now started to return home despite their homes being waterlogged and at the risk of disease outbreaks. 108 camps still exist across Tana River county. The Meteorological department continues to issue high alerts for heavy rainfall in Turkana, Marsabit, Samburu, West Pokot, Elgeyo Marakwet, Trans Nzoia, Uasin Gichu, Bungoma, Baringgo, Nakuru, Laikipia, Isiolo, Nyandarua, Kirinyaga, Meru, Tharaka Nithi, Embu, Kiambu, Nairobi, Murang’a and Nyeri. The Long Rains improved the food security outlook for the country but new threats of locust and fall army worm infestations compromise the situation. Marsabit, Isiolo and Turkana counties are the worst hit with over 494,210 acres covered by locusts. The repair of school infrastructure that was damaged during the floods is very slow. Local partners in floodaffected counties are reporting that pupils are having difficulty accessing adequate sanitation facilities. 17 counties in Kenya have been placed on high alert for Rift Valley Fever which broke out in Wajir, with 19 cases and six people reported dead. This outbreak is one of the consequences of high level of rainfall and floods in the Arid and Semi Arid Lands. Medical and veterinary workers are working to determine the extent of the epidemic and institute localized control measures. Laboratory testing material, isolation and protective material have been sent in Wajir for the response by the government. Kitui, Wajir, Kajiado and Marsabit counties are reporting a high death rate and miscarriages among animals. Reporting and investigations are hampered by logistical constraints such as road access to the affected areas. Ten counties countrywide are reporting active cholera outbreaks Nairobi, Machakos, Kiambu, Garissa, Tana River, Isiolo, Turkana, West Pokot, Elgeyo Marakwet . The Tana River county, Department of Water shared preliminary findings of 13 water samples taken from surface water hand dug along the shores of seasonal tributaries of River Tana . All sites tested showed a positive result for coliform. UNICEF and partners visited camps and villages along the Tana River. Residents reported that water pumping from treatment works by the local water service provider is erratic this is a key factor making households dig the river bed to find water for domestic consumption. Cholera is also present in Dadaab and Kakuma Kalobeyei refugee camps and settlement. The main risk factor is contaminated water collected from the nearby open water pans around which open defecation is practiced.","['Epidemic', 'Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Insect Infestation']"

"A survey by the Department of Trade, Industry and Competition has revealed that at least 826 companies were affected by the recent floods in KwaZulu Natal, with the cost of the damage estimated at R7 billion. KwaZulu Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala said on Thursday the top three districts that had the biggest impact included eThekwini Municipality with 239 companies responding, accounting for 50.6 , followed by iLembe with 87 companies, accounting for 18.43 , and the Ugu District with 54 companies accounting for 11.44 . He said the floods had affected 31 220 jobs with eThekwini accounting for 68 of the jobs affected. “The damage to Toyota has resulted in their temporary closure in the Durban South basin, an estimated 30 000 employees across the manufacturing industry are out of work currently. This means that employees could be without pay for approximately three months, given the severity of damage at Toyota South Africa. “We are, however, very encouraged by the decision and the commitment of Toyota globally and other businesses to rebuild and build back better here in KwaZulu Natal despite the setbacks and losses to business caused by the floods. Recovery priorities include working with the private sector to ensure a disaster proof rebuilding process,” Zikalala said. The Premier was addressing the media on the provincial government’s effort to recover and rebuild from the devastation caused by the floods. Improvements in port operations Zikalala announced that port operations are being improved, but are affected by the rest of the network in the province. Currently, two lanes on Bayhead Road are open and operational while the repairs to the road are being carried out. “Unfortunately, rail in the port area is damaged and will be back in operation in July 2022. There is consideration to open a new road along the railway line to ease movement of cargo. “Electricity and water challenges around the port are affecting many companies and until there is progress on roads feeding into the M7, we will be affected by costly delays at the Port of Durban,” Zikalala said. However, operations at King Shaka International Airport are back to normal with the Dube Trade Port providing water tinkering by utilising its own equipment and sourcing water from their own dams. “As a result, the much publicised water crisis at King Shaka, a strategic location especially for the tourism sector, has now thankfully been resolved,” he said. R67.5 million to support SMMEs On small, micro and medium enterprises SMMEs support, Zikalala said measures are being implemented to assist spaza shops in townships and implementing tourism sector interventions, and SMME relief for infrastructure. “For this purpose, the Department of Economic Development, Tourism and Environmental Affairs is repurposing R67.5 million towards the SMME and Co Ops Relief Fund, as approved by Provincial Treasury. “The Fund will prioritise township and rural businesses, and informal traders in eThekwini Metro, Ilembe, King Cetshwayo and uGu Districts. “In this regard, the Executive Committee has approved the application to National Treasury for the release of R1 billion funding for immediate needs while awaiting the appropriation of the rest of the disaster funds. This is to cover the shelter support, human settlement interventions, water and sanitation interventions, roads and relief,” Zikalala said. High voltage sub stations restored The Premier also reported that all high voltage sub stations have been restored, with some work still in progress on low and medium voltage faults. He noted that eThekwini alone had in excess of 100 power stations that were severely affected by the floods, leaving many parts of the city in darkness. “Power supply interruptions are being experienced in areas such as KwaNdengezi, Zwelibomvu and Marrianridge almost daily. This is caused by an electricity overload. “The city has advised that work at the Marianridge substation to resolve this problem is expected to be completed in the next two weeks,” he said. R125 000 donor funds received Meanwhile, Zikalala announced that as at 15 May 2022, a sum of R125 000 has been donated through a dedicated bank Account number 4103831039 with ABSA Bank, opened by the province. “Of this amount R100 000 is specifically earmarked for the Department of Health and the balance of R25 000 will be used towards the rebuilding process. The bulk of donor funding has been sent directly to NGOs and can be accounted for by the NGOs. “The Human Rights Commission and the United Nations Coordinating Office in South Africa will work with NGOs to ensure that citizens receive a report on who did what with the donations earmarked for the people affected by floods. “There were many announcements made by various corporate companies and all of us will need to account and be transparent about what we did and how the money earmarked for flood victims in KwaZulu Natal in 2022 was spent,” Zikalala said. – SAnews.gov.za.","['Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Mud Slide']"
"During the flooding in Bangladesh, Bibha’s house was washed away. With her family she managed to take shelter in a neighbouring house. Both she and her eldest daughter fell sick with a fever. With the roads destroyed around Kurigram she had no way to get to the health centre to get help. Bibha’s husband is a labourer, but during monsoon season he doesn’t have any work and the whole family has to survive on only one meal a day. Now their circumstances had just got much worse. Tearfund’s partner LAMB responded to the floods quickly, setting up a medical camp in Bibha’s village. ‘I had nothing to do except watch my daughter’s suffering,’ says Bibha. ‘As a mother it was painful for me to see her condition gradually deteriorating. When the LAMB medical team arrived my heart filled with hope and a doctor carefully checked my daughter and me. They gave us medicine. Now my daughter and I are fine. I thank LAMB for their generous and timely support. If it wasn’t for them I could not save my daughter.’ Rapid response The catastrophic flooding in August left more than 1,200 people dead across India, Bangladesh and Nepal. It’s estimated 41 million people have been affected by the devastation, including families like Bibha’s. Tearfund and its partners were quick to respond as nearly three quarters of a million homes were destroyed or damaged and crops and livestock swept away. Now that the flood waters have receded we’re continuing to stand with those affected and bring help where it is needed. In Bangladesh, a nation also dealing with a large influx of refugees from Myanmar, our partners LAMB and Baptist Aid distributed essential and life saving items. These included emergency food supplies, water bottles, water purification tablets, and hygiene kits for women and adolescent girls, as well as medical support. Two months after the floods the plan is to provide more assistance to help households to recover. This includes provision of seeds and fertilisers to farmers, cash grants to buy foods and house repairing materials, educational materials for schools, portable stoves and ovens, and safe drinking water points. Patrick Palma, from Tearfund’s Bangladesh team, reinforces the importance of this work ‘Because of the flooding people are suffering a lot. This support is helping them to restore their normal lives. Those affected are very thankful to Tearfund and our partners for their timely and effective response.’ Helping farmers In Nepal 90,000 homes have been destroyed. The UN has called it the worst flooding incident in the country in a decade. ‘Although the flood waters have receded, agricultural land has been left covered in silt,’says Rajan Ghimire, Tearfund’s Response Manager in Nepal.‘Households reliant on farming for their livelihoods need urgent assistance to clear their land and sow seeds during the paddy sowing season October November . If this doesn’t happen people will lose yet another harvest. ‘Providing agricultural tools, seeds and transitional shelter are essential for early recovery. This will ensure affected households are able to rebuild their livelihoods and have somewhere safe to sleep whilst they construct a permanent home.’ Tearfund is also working with church partners in Nepal to provide emergency food supplies, hygiene kits and medical assistance. Higher ground In India the floods have affected a large area. Tearfund’s Country Director, Prince David, says the Bihar region has been hit particularly hard, ‘superseding anything that we have seen in the past 10 years.’ Tearfund partners EFICOR and EHA have responded in several districts in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Assam. Their first response was to evacuate people due to the rising waters. As people moved to higher ground, food was distributed followed by materials for temporary shelters and hygiene kits. This was followed by a cash distribution programme for those who have been affected most severely. Prince David reports that so far over 600 vulnerable children have received support. Many schools have been destroyed and teachers are involved in the flood response. The big picture So far, Tearfund supporters have generously given over £270,000 to help our local partners respond to the floods through a number of projects. We’re also working to increase the resilience of communities vulnerable to disasters such as this. The longer term aspect of Tearfund’s response is our climate change campaigning, says Senior Campaigner Ben Niblett ‘Action now to cut the world’s carbon emissions is vital to stop floods like these becoming the new normal. ‘Tearfund is part of the Renew Our World campaign, uniting the church around the world to hold our leaders to their climate promises, which is why we campaign on vital issues like climate change’.","['Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Mud Slide']"

"The Tsunami Warning System established under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission IOC of UNESCO in the Indian Ocean following the December 2004 disaster is functioning effectively. This was demonstrated in a simulation exercise conducted on 9 and 10 September 2014, with the participation of 24 countries of the Indian Ocean Rim . According to the preliminary results of the simulated alert, all of the participating countries received timely tsunami advisory messages, and no delays were reported. Notification messages were issued by the Indian Ocean Regional Tsunami Service Providers Australia, India and Indonesia and sent to National Tsunami Warning Centres. On this basis, most of the participating countries successfully conducted exercises involving the national tsunami warning, disaster management and main emergency response organisations. Several countries also chose to involve the general public in the exercise, including India, Mauritius and the Seychelles, where evacuation exercises were conducted in coastal areas. Tourists and personnel were evacuated from a hotel in Mauritius. A full evaluation report of the exercise will be published in November 2014. “The terrible images of the 2004 Tsunami are still fresh in our memories. Ten years later, this new warning exercise demonstrates that the efforts of the Indian Ocean Rim countries to be better prepared for such disasters are bearing fruit. The warning system established under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO is a major achievement of global scientific cooperation that can help to save lives” declared UNESCO Director General Irina Bokova. “The Indian Ocean tsunami warning system is the result of significant international collaboration and contributions from countries all around the Indian Ocean in response to the devastating tsunami of December 2004. Countries now need to sustain the tsunami warning system, community education and response capability that have been developed across the Indian Ocean. Countries must remain alert and prepared against the ever present tsunami threat”, said Rick Bailey, Chair of the Intergovernmental Coordination Group of the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System. The exercise, known as « IOWAVE14», comprised two scenarios the first simulated an earthquake with a magnitude of 9.1 south of Java, in Indonesia, on 9 September 00 00 UTC , while the second scenario simulated an earthquake with a magnitude of 9.0 in the Makran Trench south of Iran and Pakistan. In both cases, the earthquakes would have resulted in a tsunami affecting the entire Indian Ocean. This test was designed to assess the effectiveness of communication flows between the stakeholders involved, country readiness and the efficiency of emergency procedures. The Indian Ocean nations called for the establishment of an Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System IOTWS in the wake of the 2004 catastrophe. An Intergovernmental Coordination Group was established in 2005 with the support of UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission to provide a governance mechanism for the new System, which became operational in 2011.

Badakhshan and Nooristan provinces were severely hit by two avalanches, resulting in causalities and destruction of houses. An estimated 2,359 families were reportedly affected, with 134 deaths, and 63 persons sustaining injuries in various parts of the country. The snow wreaked havoc on major roads in Afghanistan, delaying assessments and dispatching of relief assistance to affected families and rescuers, who were unable to reach snow hit districts in the north, northeast, central, central highland, and eastern regions, with numerous roads cut off. The majority of the highways that were initially closed have since reopened however, some roads linking to various districts are still closed, and efforts are underway by district authorities to reopen the roads.","['Cold Wave', 'Snow Avalanche']"
" Media Contact Erin Taylor http etaylor savechildren.org 267.250.8829 M Negin Janati http njanati savechildren.org 203.212.0044 M FAIRFIELD, Conn. October 4, 2016 – Hurricane Matthew, a Category 4 storm, slammed the southern coast of Haiti on Tuesday morning with winds of 145 mph, flooding and extensive damage. Save the Children is deploying an emergency response team to work with staff and partners on the ground to help the children and families affected by the storm. The organization pre positioned a stockpile of non food items, including hygiene kits, baby items, household kits, mosquito nets and jerry cans, which will be used in coming days. Additional necessities will be supplied after the response team conducts an initial evaluation. Our thoughts and hearts go out to the Haitian people, many of whom had yet to fully recover from the earthquake that devastated the country in 2010, said Carolyn Miles, President CEO of Save the Children. We have worked in Haiti for more than 30 years and will coordinate closely with the Haitian government to help those most affected by the disaster. Save the Children supports 131 schools in Haiti, including 27 in the area of south Grand'Anse and 39 in Port au Prince. The organization also provides technical assistance in water, sanitation and hygiene and newborn health to the Ministry of Health. Children are often most vulnerable during disasters such as this, Miles said. Our emergency response team will be carefully evaluating how we can best help children, including getting them back into school as soon as possible. Part of Save the Children's emergency response will likely include setting up child friendly spaces at evacuation centers, which will provide children with a safe place to be engaged in educational play with other children, while giving parents a much needed opportunity to go out and assess the damage.

"Rizq and his family have been living in a shelter made of metal sheets since their home was destroyed in the 2014 conflict in Gaza. This winter, as temperatures plummet below five degrees Celsius, Rizq’s family find themselves without enough heating or blankets, struggling to survive the harsh weather. Unfortunately their story is far from an isolated case. According to a survey by Shelter Cluster https www.sheltercluster.org , 23 of Gazan families live in dilapidated housing , while a further 27 live in homes that damage their health. As well as conflict, Gaza is subject to import restrictions and poor access to construction materials. Economic conditions continue to deteriorate for Palestinians. “I have been suffering since 2014 especially when the winter comes…after the conflict, everything was destroyed. All the things that I had fixed and repaired in our home were destroyed,” says Rizq. Such poor housing conditions increase the likelihood of contracting harmful infections and developing respiratory problems. Inadequate shelter is also impacting the mental health and wellbeing of families and disrupting children’s education. Rizq’s story highlights the struggle of many families in Gaza as well as those without adequate shelter around the world, including refugees and displaced people. With your support we can help them get through the winter months. “I am not asking for a miracle. I just want to live like others”, he says. In Gaza, we plan to help people like Rizq to repair and improve their homes, so their families are better protected from the wintry weather. “We can’t imagine how happy we will feel when we get our home fixed and repaired,” he says. And, through our Winter Appeal, we will give survival items such as blankets and heaters to vulnerable families in Gaza and beyond.

Situation Overview At least seven people have been killed and hundreds displaced by Tropical Storm Gombe, which has caused heavy damage mainly in southern Malawi. About 10 districts have been affected by this new flooding Mulanje, Thyolo, Chiradzulu, Phalombe, Nsanje, Chikwawa, Mangochi, Zomba, and Machinga . The flooding comes as Malawi starts to recover from the effects of tropical storm Ana, which hit the country earlier, affecting more than 900,000 people in 17 of the country’s 28 districts. Reports from Mulanje district indicate that a police station, the local Revenue Authority Offices, and an immigration office at the Mozambique border were submerged and temporarily closed. The ChikwawaNsanje road was damaged once again, making Nsanje district inaccessible by road. In several districts, sites hosting displaced people affected by tropical storm Ana and other sporadic flooding events were submerged in water. The internally displaced people IDPs had to be evacuated. Meanwhile, the Department of Disaster Management Affairs DoDMA has directed all affected districts to conduct a rapid assessment from Wednesday, March 16 to Friday, March 18. Interagency rapid assessment teams have been deployed to provide technical assistance to the District Civil Protection Committees DCPCs , assessing the damage in three districts Nsanje, Phalombe and Mulanje that the recent floods have severely hit. Outbreak of Cholera was declared in Malawi on 2 March. As of 17 March 2022, the outbreak has been reported in two districts 1 case Machinga, 5 cases Nsanje . In addition, the health authorities in Malawi declared an outbreak of wild poliovirus type 1 after a case was detected in a young child in the capital Lilongwe. This is the first case of wild Poliovirus in Africa in more than five years. No other case has been reported. Humanitarian Strategy The multiple burdens of floods, COVID 19, Polio, and Cholera outbreaks require a unique and urgent response to prevent the current emergencies from having a severe further impact on the wellbeing of children.

Response to the floods focuses on the four worst affected districts of Chikwawa, Nsanje, Phalombe, and Mulanje. UNICEF delivers the services through a multi sectoral response in child protection, education, health, nutrition, social protection, and WASH, supported by social behaviour change communication and community engagement activities.","['Epidemic', 'Tropical Cyclone']"
"By Ryan Strauss 2020 saw the unprecedented confluence of a deadly global pandemic with natural disasters worldwide – the largest wildfires ever recorded in the Western U.S. and Australia, 12 named tropical storms hitting the U.S. mainland, humanitarian disasters in Beirut and Yemen, earthquakes in Puerto Rico, and an ongoing epidemic of opioid overdose deaths. In response to these unrelenting catastrophes, Direct Relief this year worked on more fronts than ever before in its 72 year history. This report provides an overview of how Direct Relief has leveraged support from generous individuals, companies, and foundations to significantly expand global operations while continuing ongoing services and long term support for local health systems in 2020. BY THE NUMBERS Unaudited totals from January 1, 2020 – December 15, 2020 2,400 tons of medical aid worth 1.1 billion wholesale 29.3 thousand humanitarian shipments 47.1 million in grant funding 3.1 thousand organizations supported across 102 countries and 55 U.S. states and territories STRENGTHENING HEALTH SYSTEMS DURING THE COVID 19 PANDEMIC Direct Relief equips local healthcare providers serving low resource communities around the world with medicines and supplies on an ongoing basis and in response to emergencies. In 2020, the organization has been called upon to continue its support for medically vulnerable communities and those still affected by disasters from previous years while the global Covid 19 pandemic has intensified. As most global commercial and humanitarian activity significantly contracted due to Covid 19, Direct Relief drastically expanded its response efforts to become The largest nonprofit provider of medical materials, such as personal protective equipment PPE , having delivered more than 43 million masks, 7 million gloves, and millions of other PPE items free of charge to health workers on the frontlines of the pandemic. The source of the largest private philanthropic infusion of grant funding 35 million to U.S. community health centers to support their vital front line role in providing access to health care, including Covid 19 related services. A crucial supplier of actionable information products and analyses to guide operations and inform policymakers through extensive collaboration with infectious disease experts, epidemiologists, technology companies, and public agencies. THE UNITED STATES Direct Relief delivered 275 million in essential medications and supplies to more than 2,700 community health centers, free and charitable clinics, and local organizations in every state Granted 35 million of emergency funding to more than 500 safety net healthcare facilities to keep their staff safe while meeting the high demand for essential services and stepping up public health measures. PUERTO RICO Direct Relief provided more than 100 million in aid and funding to strengthen local health systems across the island in the three years since it was devastated by Hurricane Maria Provided more than 2.5 million in medical aid and hosted six health fairs for communities affected by earthquakes in January and February of 2020 Delivered PPE including more than 152,000 masks, 169,000 gloves, 36,000 face shields, and 4,000 gowns coveralls in addition to supplying ventilators, oxygen concentrators, and air purifying respirators for community health centers and hospitals. THE BAHAMAS Direct Relief became the largest provider of medical aid after Hurricane Dorian, providing more than 8.1 million of assistance, including 1.3 million defined daily doses of medicines Funded and coordinated major restorations of primary referral hospitals and the construction of new medical clinics Ensured that the island nation was prepared to prevent shortages and respond to Covid 19 as large supplies of PPE had been received in the response to Hurricane Dorian CENTRAL AMERICA Direct Relief pre positioned medicines and supplies for immediate deployment as part of emergency preparedness efforts with the World Health Organization’s Pan American Health Organization ahead of Hurricane Eta Provided nearly 10 million of essential medicines, supplies, and PPE to Honduras and Nicaragua Coordinated support for rescue teams assisting remote communities stranded by severe flooding and landslides SUB SAHARAN AFRICA Direct Relief partnered with 30 other nonprofit organizations to form the Covid 19 Action Fund for Africa to address the known need for PPE among more than 900,000 community health workers across the continent Delivered more than 57 million units of PPE masks, gloves, gowns coveralls, face shields, and more to Ministries of Health, healthcare facilities, and nonprofit partners in 12 countries. RAPIDLY MOBILIZING MEDICAL RESOURCES As overlapping health concerns compounded the effects of Covid 19 in 2020, it has been more crucial than ever before that Direct Relief can deploy necessary medicines and supplies at a moment’s notice. For years, Direct Relief has stockpiled materials in kits for deployment to support first responders in emergencies, equip health workers, and treat cholera. This year, in close consultation with experts and partners in the field, Direct Relief introduced new specialized kits to rapidly and precisely address the most pressing healthcare needs that arise when hospitals experience a surge in patients requiring intensive care The Intensive Care Unit ICU Critical Supply Module provides health workers with the required injectable IV fluids, IV and oral antibiotics, vasopressor therapies, sedatives, and other essential items to treat up to 100 patients who require critical care services for Covid 19.

RESPONDING TO WILDFIRES ACROSS THE WEST COAST Direct Relief continues to respond to wildfires of increasing frequency and intensity. Six of the 10 largest wildfires ever recorded in California raged this fall. More than 1 million acres burned across Oregon, Washington, and Colorado at the same time. In response, Direct Relief worked with public health officials and partner health facilities across the west coast to rapidly mobilize medical material aid, supplies, and PPE such as N 95 masks to filter heavy smoke particulate that fills the air during wildfires. In total, the organization delivered more than 2.2 million of aid in 307 shipments to 213 partners throughout the Western U.S. to meet the emergency health needs of those affected by this year’s devastating wildfire season. Partners in these states also received 17 wildfire kits in its first full season of distributions during emergency responses. These kits serve as a critical element of Direct Relief’s long term work with partner healthcare facilities to enhance preparedness for wildfires and efficiency of responses. Additionally, Direct Relief continues to recognize the need for power as a prerequisite for public health. In addition to assessing and, increasingly, providing power generation and backup capacity for health centers and free charitable clinics, the organization is taking a leading role to connect its partners with public financial resources and solar energy installations to increase resilience and expand capacity to accept medical product donations among these facilities. SUPPORTING MOTHERS CHILDREN In low resource countries, improvements in pregnancy care and children’s health strengthen health systems overall. In 2020, Direct Relief has supported midwives and other maternal and child healthcare providers with medicines and supplies, including Equipping trained midwives to ensure safe births in medically vulnerable communities during the pandemic with the provision of more than 380 full midwife kits and 240 replenishment kits in partnership with the International Confederation of Midwives, including the first shipment from Direct Relief to support midwives in Latin America Delivering the organization’s first shipment of aid 997 pounds of personal protective equipment to Iran in more than a decade, providing protection to midwives at the height of the pandemic in the country Expanding one of the largest global distribution programs in the world for children with type 1 diabetes in partnership with nonprofit organization Life for a Child, providing enough insulin, insulin delivery devices, blood glucose monitoring equipment, and HbA1c testing supplies to meet the needs of 14,500 children in 25 countries Committing a multi year commitment of cancer drugs in partnership with pharmaceutical manufacturer Teva, the Texas Children’s Hospital, and the Global Hope initiative in Uganda, Malawi, and Botswana.","['Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Tropical Cyclone', 'Wild Fire']"
" CARE “Mothers last ones to eat, children first ones to freeze” Syrians, fleeing over a decade of war in their homeland, have found their situation exacerbated following the onslaught of heavy winter storms. In Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, temperatures are expected to drop lower than they have in 40 years, reaching 14 degrees and lower. Strong winds reaching up to 80km h, coupled with heavy hail and snow in mountainous areas are endangering the lives of millions of people living in already precarious circumstances. “This is yet another blow to people whose lives are already beyond unbearable. People can see their own breath when lying on their thin mattresses you will see children walk around in flip flops and ripped shirts. Families are afraid that they will freeze to death,” says Jolien Veldwijk, CARE Syria Country Director. In Syria, over 6.7 million people have been internally displaced, while another 6.8 live as refugees in neighboring countries such as Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. Most displaced people found shelter in tents, unfinished buildings, and sheds, leaving them particularly vulnerable to harsh winter conditions. “With extremely low temperatures in Jordan at the moment and the long term impact of the COVID 19 pandemic, winter assistance is more crucial than ever to help the most vulnerable refugees keep a roof over their heads and their families safe from the cold,” comments Ammar Abu Zayyad, CARE Jordan Country Director. In Lebanon, refugees live across hundreds of informal settlements, lacking adequate protection. “People don’t have jobs or incomes, no access to jobs. They are already suffering consequences of an unprecedented economic crisis in Lebanon and have no means to protect themselves against the expected snowstorms,” says Bujar Hoxha, CARE Lebanon Country Director. “CARE is particularly concerned about the situation of displaced people inside Syria, especially women and children. Deteriorating shelter conditions, limited fuel supply, and the use of hazardous materials to stay warm, are giving rise to grave health and environmental impacts. During the cold winter, mothers are usually the last ones to eat, and children are usually the first ones to freeze,” says Sherine Ibrahim, CARE Turkey’s Country Director. CARE’s teams across the region have been able to help many with winterization support, including more than 86,000 people in Syria and 4,000 people in Jordan. Across Syria and the region, CARE is supporting displaced people with insulating their tents, strengthening makeshift shelters, and distributing warm clothing, blankets, and cash. Cash is particularly important for people living in informal tent settlements to afford fuel for heating, as they are most affected by the cold. “This crisis response remains severely underfunded. This year, we’ve only received a fraction of the funding needed to prepare people for the winter and protect them against the cold. Only 46 of the funding needed to support Syrians is currently available. The conflict in Syria has been ongoing for almost eleven years, and we are afraid donors are growing tired of funding humanitarian assistance. Unfortunately, the needs have only increased over the past years, and right now we can see people fearing to freeze to death because desperately needed funding is unavailable”, says Jolien Veldwijk. While snowfall and sub zero temperatures are not unusual in the Middle East, climate change has caused increased flooding and rainfall. “Flash floods are simply washing away the tents and the few belongings people were able to take when their houses were bombed. The winters are getting harsher and deadlier, while families are less and less able to cope with freezing temperatures,” says Veldwijik.","['Cold Wave', 'Flash Flood']"

" SITUATION AT A GLANCE Since late June, Government of Burma military operations against the Arakan Army AA armed group have resulted in increased population displacement in Rakhine State. Humanitarian access in the affected areas remains highly restricted, and protection issues persist throughout Rakhine. Restrictions related to coronavirus disease COVID19 have limited humanitarian access and impeded critical activities in Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar District. On September 5, Government of Bangladesh officials hosted “go and see” visits for 40 Rohingya refugees and several camp officials to Bhasan Char Island—a previously uninhabited and flood prone island in the Bay of Bengal. KEY DEVELOPMENTS Military Operations Drive Population Displacement in Northern Rakhine Between June 25 and 30, a Government of Burma military offensive against the AA in northern and eastern areas of Rakhine’s Rathedaung Township displaced at least 2,800 people to other areas of Rathedaung, as well as neighboring Buthidaung, Ponnagyun, and Sittwe townships, the UN reports. Prior to the late June military offensive, the AA–Government of Burma conflict had already displaced an estimated 14,600 people in Rathedaung. Humanitarian access to Rathedaung remains limited, restricting needs assessments and the delivery of assistance to new internally displaced persons IDPs and affected host communities, according to the UN. The AA–Government of Burma conflict has displaced more than 86,000 people—77,000 of whom now reside in IDP sites in Rakhine—since hostilities intensified in late 2018. Additionally, according to an April Oxfam survey, displaced Rohingya and Kaman women in IDP camps in Rakhine face particular challenges due to significant protection risks, crowded shelter conditions, and impediments to accessing health care. Rohingya and Kaman women surveyed reported spending most of their time in small, overcrowded shelters and being discouraged from leaving the shelters to access health care and other services due to movement restrictions and gender norms. Rohingya and Kaman women also reported the risk of gender based violence GBV , particularly when accessing the camps’ public latrines at night. As the Government of Burma’s national camp closure strategy—the Government of Burma’s plan to close or relocate IDP camps throughout the country—proceeds, Oxfam and other relief agencies continue to advocate the lifting of movement restrictions, improvement of shelter conditions in the camps, and consultation with IDPs on durable solutions as immediate priorities to assist women and other vulnerable populations in IDP camps in Rakhine. Relief Organizations Continue COVID 19 Advocacy and Response in Rakhine Humanitarians have expressed concern about a recent outbreak of community transmission and surge in confirmed cases that began in Rakhine’s capital of Sittwe in mid August. As of September 1, the Government of Burma Ministry of Health and Sports confirmed 409 COVID 19 cases in Rakhine since mid May, of which 393 cases were confirmed between August 16 and September 1 additionally, on August 31, health actors confirmed the first COVID 19 case in an IDP site in Rakhine. Across Burma, health agencies have confirmed 2,265 COVID 19 cases as of September 11, the UN World Health Organization WHO reports. WHO is continuing advocacy efforts with and providing technical support to the Ministry of Health and Sports and the Rakhine State Health Department to curb the outbreak in Rakhine, including through improving COVID 19 isolation, patient transport, triage, and treatment capacity strengthening infection prevention and control protocols and adherence educating staff on personal protective equipment PPE use and enhancing disease surveillance and reporting. U.S. Government USG partners operating in Burma are also implementing measures to reduce COVID 19 transmission among beneficiaries, humanitarian workers, and host communities by encouraging the proper use of PPE, emphasizing effective handwashing and sanitation practices, and maintaining spaces for adequate physical distancing at distribution sites. Flooding Affects Vulnerable Populations in Kachin State In mid July, flooding caused by monsoon rains temporarily displaced more than 6,500 people in 19 townships across Burma’s Kachin State, the UN reports. Additionally, heavy rains in western Kachin in early July triggered a landslide that resulted in at least 172 deaths and more than 50 injuries. Humanitarian organizations continue to implement preparedness measures to mitigate the impact of flooding throughout Kachin, including coordinating with local authorities to establish contingency stocks of relief items to facilitate the efficient deployment of supplies when needed. USG partners are providing health assistance and protection services, as well as water, sanitation, and hygiene WASH kits to vulnerable communities affected by the flooding. Rohingya Recognize Three Years Since Mass Displacement From Burma On August 25, the international community joined Rohingya refugees in recognizing the three year anniversary of the Rohingya mass exodus from Burma beginning on August 25, 2017, a Government of Burma military campaign in western Burma prompted more than 700,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh. In marking of the anniversary, the Inter Sector Coordination Group ISCG —a humanitarian coordinating body comprising UN agencies, non governmental organizations NGOs , and other stakeholders in Bangladesh’s Rohingya refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar—acknowledged the resilience of Rohingya refugees and the generosity of Bangladeshi host communities, called for renewed support to address the humanitarian crisis, and reaffirmed its commitment to meeting the critical needs of the affected communities and identifying durable solutions for refugees, including their safe, dignified, sustainable, and voluntary return to Burma when conditions allow. COVID 19 Complicates Protection Service Delivery in Cox’s Bazar The outbreak of COVID 19 in Cox’s Bazar and containment measures by local authorities have significantly impeded GBV interventions, mental health and psychosocial support activities, and other protection focused humanitarian services within the district, according to a June Assessment Capacities Project ACAPS report. Humanitarian organizations have had limited direct access to GBV survivors, which has hindered efficient and confidential response to individual needs. In response to these protection gaps, as of mid August relief organizations in Cox’s Bazar and the Government of Bangladesh Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner RRRC were in discussions about implementing a July National Task Force decision to officially resume protection and additional critical services in the camps, the ISCG reports. Due to access restrictions for humanitarian staff, relief organizations have recruited and trained approximately 2,000 refugee volunteers since May to assist in disseminating critical messaging on GBV prevention and protection initiatives throughout the camps and host communities, ACAPS reports. Additionally, USAID BHA partner the International Organization for Migration IOM has provided mental health and psychosocial support messaging to approximately 43,100 people, distributed emergency relief supplies to nearly 1,100 beneficiaries, and trained nearly 40 isolation and treatment center staff to respond to incidents of GBV in Cox’s Bazar as of July 24. IOM also continued to support local primary health care facilities, where medical staff provided more than 25,300 primary health consultations to residents of Cox’s Bazar and the surrounding area during the same time period. Relief Actors Aim to Mitigate Impacts of COVID 19, Flooding in Cox’s Bazar Amid ongoing heavy monsoon rainfall throughout Bangladesh, relief actors—including USG partners CARE, IOM, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR , and the UN Children’s Fund UNICEF —are continuing COVID 19 and disaster risk reduction DRR programming in Cox’s Bazar to address the impacts of the monsoon rainfall and minimize transmission risks for COVID 19 and other waterborne and vector borne diseases. Despite limited access to the refugee camps due to weather conditions and COVID 19 mitigation measures imposed by the Government of Bangladesh, relief organizations continued to implement activities, including livelihoods, health, protection, shelter, and WASH programs, in July. As part of these efforts, relief organizations completed nearly 80 landslide mitigation projects and repaired more than 160 feet of drainage infrastructure, nearly 160 staircases, and nearly 500 feet of bridges in the camps that had been damaged during the floods. The organizations also conducted awareness raising sessions for 350 Rohingya households on insulating shelters from the monsoon rains, and continued to repair latrines and bathing cubicles damaged by the heavy rainfall. Government of Bangladesh Reaffirms Intent to Relocate Refugees In an August 24 public statement, Government of Bangladesh Foreign Secretary Masud Bin Momen reaffirmed the government’s intent to relocate Rohingya refugees to Bhasan Char Island and outlined a relocation plan and timeline, starting with moving 10,000 refugees to the island following Bangladesh’s June to October monsoon season. In early May, the Government of Bangladesh already transferred more than 300 Rohingya stranded at sea to Bhasan Char. Since then, the UN has been negotiating terms of reference TORs to conduct a humanitarian protection visit for the refugees on Bhasan Char in his remarks, Bin Momen reiterated government support for UN access to Bhasan Char to establish a response framework for the island, but agreement on the protection assessment TORs remains outstanding. On September 5, the Government of Bangladesh armed forces escorted 40 Rohingya community leaders, two female refugees, and several government representatives, including Camp in Charge and Office of the RRRC officials, from the refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar to Bhasan Char Island for a three day “go and see” visit to better inform the refugees about the island, local media report. WHO Urges Increased COVID 19 Testing in Cox’s Bazar Host Communities WHO has called for increased COVID 19 testing among Cox’s Bazar host communities following a reduction in testing rates since July, when the Government of Bangladesh introduced testing fees refugees in the district are not charged for COVID 19 testing. Although the fee was recently reduced from 2.50 to approximately 1.20, the fee remains a significant deterrent from host community members getting tested, WHO reports host community stigma around COVID 19 has also deterred testing. The UN agency has urged for greater community engagement in host communities to increase testing rates and encourage early diagnosis of the disease and isolation of cases. While testing has decreased, the positive COVID 19 test result rate for the host community continues to fluctuate between 10 to 20 percent, compared to the approximately 2 percent positive rate in Cox’s Bazar refugee camps. In the refugee camps, WHO notes that the majority of test samples collected were among refugees ages 29 years and younger, and has advocated for increased testing among older age groups, amid other robust COVID 19 preparedness and response activities in the camps. As of September 11, WHO reported 130 confirmed COVID 19 cases among the refugee population in Cox’s Bazar, 4,082 cases within Cox’s Bazar host communities, and 332,970 cases nationwide.","['Epidemic', 'Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Land Slide']"
"On 28 September, a 7.4 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Indonesia triggered a tsunami, affecting approx. 1.5 million people in Sulawesi. Around 71,000 are displaced and access to remote communities is challenging. In Central Sulawesi, some 500,000 people need urgent access to water and sanitation services. Prior to the disaster, Palu, the main urban centre of Sulawesi, had a low Measles Rubella MR immunization coverage at 49 per cent and a high prevalence of wasting and stunting. The recent disaster exacerbates these pre existing vulnerabilities, increasing the risk of disease outbreaks for thousands of children and their families. More than 2,700 schools have been affected, directly impacting the education of 270,000 children in Central Sulawesi. There are approximately 5,000 separated children and 100.000 children require of psycho social support. In addition, UNICEF continues to respond to the August 2018 Lombok earthquakes, which displaced 340,000 people. Humanitarian strategy UNICEF responds to the earthquake tsunami disaster in Sulawesi and Lombok under the leadership of the Government of Indonesia, and in partnership with local and international NGOs, focusing on life saving service delivery and early recovery. The tsunami response is fully aligned with the Central Sulawesi Earthquake Response Plan released on 4 October. In Sulawesi, UNICEF’s response focuses on strengthening sectoral coordination and on provision of critical life saving support across all sectors by building on existing capacities. The provision of child protection services including for separated and unaccompanied children, as well as education, are key priorities. In Lombok, UNICEF is scaling up recovery activities across all sectors. UNICEF supports the Ministry of Health in charge of the Health Cluster, leading on nutrition and Water Sanitation and Hygiene WASH for hygiene promotion, as well as maternal, child health and immunization. UNICEF also provides coordination support to the Ministry of Public Works as the lead on WASH infrastructure. UNICEF and YSTC Save the Children national chapter co lead the coordination support to the Ministry of Education, leading the Education cluster. UNICEF and Muhammadiyah Disaster Management Center co lead cluster coordination support to the Ministry of Social Affairs, leading on Child Protection under the National Displacement and Protection Cluster. Results from 2018 As of October 2018, UNICEF has achieved the following results in Lombok. Child protection support has been provided through the Ministry of Social Affairs and in conjunction with the Ministry of Education for psychosocial activities. Key results are • Education in Emergency and CPiE integrated training for 60 education officials. • GBV trainings for 50 to 60 women’s groups and community leaders. • 50 social workers and volunteers are working on child protection responses reaching 1,500 children. • Training and support for social workers and members volunteers of local CSOs provided in Lombok covering 20 – 30 displacement sites. • Joint secretariat on child protection has been established and is operational serving as a coordination mechanism for emergency response. • Initial plan for Child Protection Sectoral Assessment has been finalized with the national and provincial social affairs department, Yayasan Sayangi Tunas Cilik Save the Children , Wahana Visi Indonesia World Vision , Plan International Indonesia. In Sulawesi, Government led initial assessments at the inter agency level are still ongoing. UNICEF has sent a second wave of personnel to the earthquake affected areas to support assessments and initial response. Funding Requirements UNICEF requires US 26.6 million to meet the humanitarian needs of children affected by the earthquake in Lombok and the earthquake – tsunami in Sulawesi. To ensure a timely scale up of UNICEF’s humanitarian response in Sulawesi, UNICEF HQ advanced a loan of US 4 million from its Emergency Programme Fund EPF . Adequate, timely and flexible funding is essential to enable UNICEF to provide life saving support to affected children and their families in both Lombok and Sulawesi islands. Sixty percent of the resource requirements sought in this appeal will be for Sulawesi response and forty percent for the Lombok response.","['Earthquake', 'Tsunami']"

" CANBERRA January 9, 2020 A new reality is taking place for Australians as catastrophic bushfires upend the lives of millions. Projections from climate scientists are now becoming the harsh reality and should serve as a wake up call to other countries around the world to take action. Up to now, the climate crisis has been felt primarily by the most vulnerable, predominantly living in the Global South, while richer countries have largely turned a blind eye and continued fueling the crisis. The impacts are now hitting the Global North, and the bushfires in Australia are just a glimpse of the future that the entire world will face if climate inaction continues. International aid agency CARE calls on governments around the world to take more seriously their international responsibilities and increase efforts to fight the global climate crisis. “What starts as a decade on fire must become the decade of decisive and rapid climate action. Anything less than halving global CO2 emissions by 2030 may lead to a runaway climate crisis. The suffering of the Australian people and environment is a stark reminder for all signatories to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change that achieving its goals is a matter of survival and justice,” says Sven Harmeling, CARE’s Global Policy Lead on Climate Change and Resilience. The awful bushfires currently ravaging Australia are just one sign of the worsening climate crisis on a global level. It is irrefutable that the concurrence and intensity of Australia’s bushfires are exacerbated by human caused climate change. But the global response needs to go beyond addressing these bushfires and must address the underlying causes. “Our country is in flames. Drought and increased temperatures have contributed to catastrophic bushfire conditions. The scientific evidence is indisputable there is a link between the tragedy we are now experiencing and climate change. If a country like Australia can experience this scale of disaster, what risks are faced in countries with less capacity to respond and recover? We must take collective responsibility and action,” says Louise Gray, Interim Chief Executive and Chief Operating Officer, CARE Australia. The good news is that there are some real and tangible actions that countries, including Australia, can take right now to help mitigate this unprecedented climate emergency. As Harmeling notes, “It is vital that countries stop escalating the climate crisis by immediately shifting away from fossil fuels to renewable energies, while also better preparing for unavoidable climate impacts. If we do not see countries, like Australia, make a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, the devastating impacts of climate change will further ravage the planet, and not even the richest countries will be immune.” About CARE Founded in 1945, CARE is a leading humanitarian organization fighting global poverty and providing lifesaving assistance in emergencies. CARE has more than seven decades of experience helping people prepare for disasters, providing lifesaving assistance when a crisis hits, and helping communities recover after the emergency has passed.

" b CONSOLIDATED INTER AGENCY APPEAL FOR 2001 FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA b br b OVERVIEW BY THE UNITED NATIONS HUMANITARIAN COORDINATOR DAVID MORTON b p STOCKHOLM 29 NOVEMBER 2000 p Our observations confirm that the condition of children has improved since the peak of the crisis in 1996 97, but their health is still at risk and the crisis continues it is by no means over. In fact, this year's poor harvest threatens a reversal if we do not address the situation. p To understand why the DPRK continues to need humanitarian assistance for the sixth year running, we need to look at the country's situation. DPRK is a country that was heavily industrialised. 60 of its population live in urban areas. It is a mountainous country with only 20 of its area suitable for agriculture, and it experiences prolonged, severe winters. Because of these factors, the country's agricultural potential is limited. Farming has always been very intensively managed, and relies heavily on very high inputs of fertilisers and on electrically pumped irrigation systems for rice production. Since the late 1980s, the country lost its traditional trading partnerships with the Socialist countries. This had a severe impact on the country's industrial base including energy production during the 1990s, as previously imported fuel, raw materials and spare parts were no longer available. Food production declined because three factories that used to produce fertiliser locally could only produce very small quantities because of the shortage of energy and raw materials. Rice production was also increasingly affected by shortages of energy to power the irrigation systems and by the deteriorating condition of pumps and piping. All these problems are compounded by erratic weather conditions including recurrent floods and droughts, that have occurred since the mid 1990s. p The recent FAO WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission estimates that this year's harvest is worse than those of 1998 and 1999. The crops were hit by a drought earlier in the year, which affected all of North East Asia, as well as tropical storm damage, and a shortage of electricity, and fuel which has greatly hindered irrigation and water delivery systems. The reduced harvest means that next year's total food import requirement will increase to 1.87 million tons as compared to 1.33 million tons during the current year. p There has been little improvement in the delivery of national health services. Most hospitals are unheated during the winter. Children are at particular risk from diarrhoeal diseases from contaminated water, and acute respiratory infections. One third of pregnant women suffer from anaemia, and the prevalence of babies born under 2.5 kgs suggests that pregnant and lactating women are themselves malnourished. Their children are vulnerable from birth, and they may not be able to breastfeed them. The provision of clean water is affected by power cuts, which stop electrical pumping of water and by a shortage of water purification chemicals, and the deterioration of water and sewage pipes. Despite universal access, basic education is under threat due to a shortage of teaching materials. Most schools are unheated during the freezing winter months. The underlying problems can only be mitigated by recovery of the economy, not by humanitarian aid alone. The purpose of this Consolidated Appeal for the DPRK is to help provide a safety net for the most vulnerable people. The Common Humanitarian Action Plan, described in detail in the Appeal document, has been produced by an inclusive process at the country level, guided by an active humanitarian working group. The Action Plan has thus been developed by all the agencies and NGOs in the DPRK together with the full participation of the NGOs both resident and non resident, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, EU officials and donor representatives. The Government also supports it. I am pleased to report that four NGOs have decided to include their programmes in the Consolidated Appeal document, which is a sign of confidence in the process leading to the formulation of the Appeal and the final result. p The Action Plan identifies that the plight of vulnerable people in the DPRK results from the interaction of several factors a lack of food resulting in poor nutrition, exacerbated by diarrhoeal diseases caused by drinking contaminated water, together with poor sanitary facilities and practices. Only if these are all tackled together will we be able to preserve the lives of our target beneficiaries. Donors have been generous in the provision of food aid through WFP, but the essential complementary programmes in health, water, sanitation and education are very much under funded. This year, programmes of UNICEF, WHO, FAO and UNDP and UNFPA were funded less than 20 . I urge donors to redress this situation. p The Common Humanitarian Action Plan aims to ul li provide food aid and a nutritional safety net to the most vulnerable thus averting a famine li support efforts to increase domestic food production li provide resources for the provision of basic life sustaining services in the health and water and sanitation sectors li provide capacity building support to service providers and technical experts in agriculture, health nutrition, water and sanitation and education activities li strengthen linkages between emergency operations and longer term rehabilitation and development programmes li improve the operating environment for humanitarian organisations active in DPR Korea. ul Full details of all the agencies' and NGOs appeals are contained in the a href http www.reliefweb.int w rwb.nsf 9ca65951ee22658ec125663300408599 b02fdffa4e6015dec1256999004c3bd1?OpenDocument Appeal Document a . Excluding the food aid component, agencies are appealing for a total of 68 million, as compared with 91 million last year. Some agencies have reduced the amounts they are appealing for this year, not because of a reduction in needs, but because of low support by donors. The country's needs go far beyond what is being requested. p It is not easy for agencies to implement programmes in the DPRK. Difficulties include a lack of information and data, constraints on access and monitoring, and difficulties to assess the impact of programmes. DPRK is a country that is still technically in a state of war National security concerns are paramount for the Government and are stated to be the reasons for the constraints on access and information. Nevertheless, there has been a very dramatic improvement in agency working conditions since the start of relief programmes in 1995 and the agencies and NGOs believe that progress continues to be made. There have been slow but steady improvements in mutual understanding and in confidence building. p Humanitarian aid provides a safety net for the most vulnerable but cannot address the underlying problems. The living conditions and the health of people will only improve through medium and long term efforts for recovery of the economy. Efforts to engage in a dialogue on recovery are coordinated through the Round Table Process. The Consolidated Appeal process for humanitarian assistance programmes and the Round Table process for recovery proceed in very close coordination with each other, to ensure a seamless transition from relief to recovery. The success of recovery in agriculture and in other key areas of the economy such as energy is essential to provide an exit strategy for the humanitarian programmes. p I urge donors to generously support this Consolidated Appeal for the needy people of the DPRK. p Thank you.",['Extratropical Cyclone']
"Media Contact Erin Taylor 267.250.8829 M Stories of survival bring hope to those hardest hit FAIRFIELD, Conn. October 3, 2018 – Children who lost or were separated from their families during Friday’s devastating earthquake and tsunami urgently need to be identified and reunited with surviving relatives, warns Save the Children. More than 46,000 children are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, according to Indonesia’s disaster authority. More than 1400 people have been confirmed dead, including hundreds of children, and more than 65,000 homes are destroyed. Child Protection Advisor Zubedy Koteng is in Palu, the epicenter of the crisis. “Moving around the streets, the destruction is everywhere. It’s hard to recognize where some buildings once stood, such is the scale of damage,” Koteng said. “I’m particularly worried about children who’ve been separated from their families or are now orphans because their parents have lost their lives in this tragedy. Many of these children are sleeping on the streets because they simply have nowhere to go. It’s hard to imagine a more frightening situation for a child. “Many children are in shock and traumatized, alone and afraid. Young children searching for surviving relatives will have witnessed and lived through horrific experiences which no child should ever have to see or undergo.” On Wednesday, Dimas told Save the Children staff how his nine year old sister Puri was trapped under rubble for five hours after the earthquake. She was found buried next to a dead body and was barely conscious at the time. However, Puri had one hand free and was able to attract attention. People immediately started to remove the rubble and she was freed. “Our house, where Puri was found, shifted almost 50 meters from its original location. Very few houses remain intact. I didn't expect anything to be saved at that time. Puri’s survival was a miracle,” said Dimas . Save the Children’s national entity has a team of staff on the ground in Palu preparing to begin distributing aid, including shelter kits and hygiene items, as well as setting up child friendly spaces, which provide a safe space for children to play, often instead of being on the streets. The humanitarian organization is also working to establish family tracing and reunification procedures with other agencies to help reunite children with their families, as well as to establish child protection systems and reporting mechanisms to keep children safe. “Reunifying separated children with their surviving family members is a major protection priority and will involve careful coordination between agencies and the government. For children who have been orphaned, we will try to find other relatives who can care for them,” Koteng said. “Reaching communities in Sulawesi is really challenging due to its remoteness coupled with the devastation that the tsunami has wreaked, cutting off transport links, which makes children separated from their families even more vulnerable.” Save the Children has been working in Indonesia since 1976 and has a long history responding to humanitarian disasters in the country, including the recent earthquakes in Lombok and the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami.","['Earthquake', 'Tsunami']"

"Ulaanbaatar, April 11 2016 In response to the recent Dzud disaster that has directly affected the lives of as many as 63,000 nomadic households in Mongolia, the United Nations mobilized 2.4 million from its Central Emergency Relief Fund CERF under the rapid response window. As part of this assistance, food, nutrition packages and hygiene kits were handed over today to the National Emergency Management Agency NEMA for immediate distribution to women and children in affected communities. Since last December an estimated 41 percent of the total herder population have been affected by harsh winter weather conditions involving extreme cold and compact layers of snow, which are locally known as Dzud. Out of this, an estimated 11,800 herder households with less than 100 animals in the most affected districts are considered particularly vulnerable. Over 1,800 children under five years old and more than 900 pregnant and lactating women in 45 ‘soums’ in six provinces Uvs, Bayankhongor, Arkhangai, Zavkhan, Dundgobi and Sukhbaatar – are targeted to receive the UN packages. UNICEF in collaboration with Ministry of Health and Sport and World Vision International Mongolia provides life saving food and nutrition interventions to ensure food security of the affected households and prevent them, particularly vulnerable children, and pregnant and lactating women from micronutrient deficiencies. The nutrition component covers supply and distribution of multiple micronutrient supplements for children aged 6 59 months old and pregnant and lactating women in target soums and provinces affected by dzud. It will also provide nutrition screening for identification of cases of acute malnutrition and adequate nutrition counselling to the dzud affected population, particularly for parents of children under two years old and pregnant and lactating women. UNFPA provides 7,962 Dignity Kits, i.e. 2 kits per household, to the women and girls in the affected areas which include sanitary supplies, underwear, clothes, socks, towels and soaps and protection items including whistles and torches with batteries. The kits are to preserve an appropriate level of sanitation of women and girls as well as their health, safety and dignity, and they are to prioritize and meet their special needs in humanitarian settings. UNFPA also extends support to soum health centers so that an estimated 500 pregnant and post partum women receive ante natal care and other reproductive health services in the affected areas. “In any emergency, women and children are the most vulnerable. Children are especially vulnerable to disease and malnutrition. Extreme cold poses increased risk of Acute Respiratory Infections ARI , pneumonia and other infectious disease measles and chickenpox among children, as their immune systems are lower due to undernutrition.” says Roberto Benes, UNICEF Mongolia Representative. “That is why micronutrient supplements are so important in reducing maternal and child morbidity and mortality in dzud affected areas”. Women and girls are the backbone of Mongolian society and we must take concrete steps to ensure their safety and dignity is protected in Dzud situations says Naomi Kitahara, UNFPA Representative. Working with the Government of Mongolia to target support to women through the provision of dignity kits will help promote the health and well being of herding communities across the country. “The assistance provided by the UN aims at addressing the most urgent survival and livelihood needs of 4,390 vulnerable herder households affected by the dzud and complements the Government response, which focuses on infrastructure and service provision” says Beate Trankmann, UN Resident Coordinator.

" KEY FACTS More than 14 million people are now displaced as a result of the conflicts in Syria and Iraq. The humanitarian appeals for Syria and neighbouring countries in 2015 is only 22 funded. Faced with limited international support and huge strains on their economies, the countries neighbouring Syria are increasing the entry restrictions for Syrian refugees and people are being turned back at the borders. More than 12.2 million people inside Syria are in need of assistance – many of them receive only sporadic or no support. Despite repeated UN resolutions meant to secure people access to humanitarian assistance, bureaucratic and administrative challenges created by authorities, attacks on humanitarian workers and active conflict continue to hamper the relief effort, according to the NRC report “Failing Syria”. Also in Iraq many civilians in conflict areas have limited access to assistance. SYRIA • NRC is focusing on the areas with the largest needs and where we can access with minimal risk. We deliver aid based on needs in an impartial, independent and neutral manner. • In addition to the work done by NRC’s Syrian employees directly, we also work with trusted Syrian partner organizations. • NRCs emergency response includes distributions of tents and winter summer kits made up of basic necessities for living. • NRC has assisted in repair of water and sanitation infrastructure. • NRC works in camps where necessary, assisting in site planning, infrastructure and camp management training where possible. • NRC is also involved in rehabilitation of schools and community centres for internally displaced and distributes teacher and student kits so children can continue their education. JORDAN • NRC is the lead partner of UNHCR in providing shelter and basic household items in Zaatari and Azraq refugee camps. NRC provides refugees with support upon arrival and operates the distribution area. NRC is also distributing cash and vouchers to offer beneficiaries more choice and flexibility. • NRC is working to ensure that children are able to get back to school and is also providing specialised youth programmes and catch up programmes. • NRC is providing financial incentives and support to Jordanian landlords to finish semi constructed houses and bring new units onto the rental market, in return for housing refugee families. • NRC is providing information, counselling and community support activities to refugees in urban and camp settings IRAQ • NRC has scaled up to provide emergency assistance to Iraqi displaced, while continuing supporting Syrian refugees • NRC is one of the main shelter actors in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and is also scaling up the response in the South Central regions of Iraq. NRC supports rehabilitation of shelter and provides life saving assistance during the winter months. • NRC runs education programmes in six camps and will expand further in 2015. • NRC has also established community outreach centers in several camps.

" Disasters displace more people than conflict and violence As climate change intensifies, extreme weather events, such as floods, storms, bushfires and heatwaves are forcing millions from their homes each year. In 2018, disasters displaced 17.2 million people from their homes, 90 per cent fled weather and climate related hazards. There were 1,600 recorded disaster events over the course of 2018 but the real number is much higher. Most disasters go unreported. Small and localised, they are largely ignored by the media, striking in remote and inaccessible areas where communities are left to fend for themselves with little or no government support. Disaster displacement is generally temporary where people are able to return home relatively quickly after an evacuation. But ‘mega disasters’ such as earthquakes and tsunamis can result in millions facing prolonged displacement. Most take refuge with host families or in rented accommodation, rather than in communal shelters or camps. Of the 1.5 million people displaced by the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, 38,000 remained in temporary accommodation eight years later. Disaster displacement is often a result of a multitude of inter connected factors. Climate change and environmental degradation driven by unsustainable economic growth and poor development practices. Conflict over water, land and other natural resources may follow, driving people to migrate elsewhere. Without concrete climate and development action, just over 143 million people in Sub Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America or around 2.8 percent of the population of these three regions could be forced to move within their own countries to escape the slow onset impacts of climate change. More than 80 per cent of all new disaster displacements over the past 20 years around 187 million occurred in the Asia Pacific region 3 where disasters have slowed development efforts. On its current trajectory, Asia will be unable to meet the UN sustainable goals by 2030. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan struck central Philippines. Haiyan was the worst recorded storm in the countries’ history, leaving over 1 million homes damaged or destroyed. The economic impacts of caring for and sheltering those left homeless coupled with peoples lost incomes, amounted to 816 million in the six months following the disaster. 4 Disaster displacement represents one of the most significant humanitarian and development challenges of the 21st century. Tackling its causes and impacts is complex, but having good data is a key part of the solution. To factor in disaster placement into development planning, policymakers require an understanding of the true nature and extent of disaster displacement. Collaboration between States in sharing technologies and innovation must accompany investments in better data gathering that maps risks, losses and trends. This will go a long way towards reducing the human and economic burden that defines disaster displacement.","['Fire', 'Flood', 'Heat Wave', 'Tsunami']"
"Islamic Relief has pledged 5 million in emergency funding to help the people of Lebanon recover from the huge explosion in Beirut on Tuesday and to support those worst affected – many of whom have lost everything. The deadly blast in Lebanon’s capital has left a catastrophic level of casualties in its wake. Hundreds of people are dead, and dozens are still missing. More than 300,000 people became homeless and the number is likely to rise as more buildings are starting to collapse. Hospitals are operating beyond their capacity to treat the wounded as over 5,000 people were admitted to different health facilities on the first day alone. The explosion has exacerbated the already severe economic crisis in the country. For months many Lebanese families were struggling to survive as the Lebanese currency value dropped, and the unemployment rate passed 30 . Said Nidal Ali, Islamic Relief’s Country Director in Lebanon – who is available for interviews – expresses how profoundly the disaster is affecting communities on the ground Food insecurity is likely to intensify in the coming weeks, the country's wheat stock for the next 18 months was stored in a warehouse near the port, and we are expecting bakeries to run out of flour within days, which will create a massive crisis,” he explains. “Most people have been able to find alternative temporary accommodation with families, friends and in their home villages or are staying temporarily in hotels. But the most impoverished especially labourers have nowhere to go and are completely without shelter or accommodation of any kind. Last night some slept in the streets among the rubble. A few hundred have not been able to find any kind of shelter. “Our main goal right now is to provide food and water to those who need it urgently. We started distributing ready to eat meals, essential non food items, hygiene kits and health assistance. Our team was on the ground yesterday clearing the roads with volunteer groups and other aid organisations, as well as many ordinary residents just doing what they can. The funds pledged by the global Islamic Relief family will fund several projects. Islamic Relief Lebanon is aiming to provide 7,500 people with food parcels for the next two months as well as non food items such as lamps, fans, hygiene kits, tarpaulins and blankets for 10,000 people. The explosion will have a long term impact on the entire country,” says Naser Haghamed, CEO of Islamic Relief Worldwide. “We are working on plans to address longer term development needs in Lebanon, including rehabilitation and livelihoods support that will aid the recovery of the Lebanese people and tackle the ongoing economic crisis and coronavirus outbreak. Lebanon was in lockdown because of a surge in Covid19 infections when the explosion occurred. Currently, there is enormous pressure on the health sector as four main hospitals were damaged and stopped working when the blast struck the city. Intensive care units are already at full capacity with Covid19 patients. We are very concerned about the Covid19 situation,” adds Nidal Ali. “We were told that medicines and Covid19 supplies such as masks, gloves and PPE were stored in the port and were all destroyed during the explosion. We are concerned there will be another outbreak in light of the recent events. Currently, we are supporting hospitals by providing ready to eat snacks for patients and staff. We have distributed 10,000 snacks since Tuesday. “As the launch of our pledges and funding appeals show, Islamic Relief is committed to doing what we can and providing all the help and support possible.’’ Notes to Editors For more information or to arrange an interview, please contact Manal Ameer manal.ameer irworldwide.org.","['Epidemic', 'Technological Disaster']"
" Key messages A deadly mix of conflict, COVID 19 and the climate crisis have pushed more than 7 million people across seven countries in East Africa to the very brink of a hunger crisis. Of critical concern are vulnerable children who are experiencing high levels of malnutrition. Conflict is the leading driver of hunger globally. Every country where World Vision works in East Africa is either in conflict or neighbouring a country in conflict. The region has also endured substantial climate shocks, undermining people’s ability to feed themselves, and the economic consequences of the COVID 19 pandemic are driving hunger to unprecedented levels. Conflict and weather shocks have resulted in multiple instances of large scale displacement in northern Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia and areas of South Sudan. Humanitarian needs are immense and the impact on children, including safeguarding risks, is enormous. This challenging period could also erode human and economic development gains that have been made towards the global 2030 Sustainable Development Goals across the region. World Vision is deeply concerned for millions of children in East Africa, who are enduring a devastating hunger crisis. According to the Food Security and Nutrition Working Group special report of 10 February 2022, an estimated 5.5 million children are acutely malnourished, including more than 1.6 million who are extremely acutely malnourished, in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia. World Vision has reached more than 5.7 million people, including 3 million children, through its East Africa Hunger Emergency Response. We are already responding with food distribution in multiple countries. World Vision has re declared its multi country response comprising Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. We aim to reach approximately 7 million people, including 3.4 million children. World Vision has been implementing a multicountry hunger emergency response in the above mentioned countries for the last 12 months and was able to repurpose and raise new funds, to the tune of US 132 million. However, the needs have insurmountably increased and we require an additional US 77 million.","['Drought', 'Epidemic', 'Insect Infestation', 'Other']"
" KINSHASA, 18 November 2020 UNICEF welcomes the announcement by the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC today confirming the end of the latest Ebola outbreak in Equateur province in the north west of the country. The 11th outbreak to hit the DRC since 1976, and the second in Equateur in less than two years, the outbreak killed 55 people and infected 130. Two children died and 11 were infected. “Though the outbreak is over, children affected by the Ebola epidemic will still require special attention and care, as communities affected begin to return to normal life,” said Edouard Beigbeder, UNICEF Representative in the DRC. “Throughout the latest epidemic to hit DRC, we have worked with our partners to meet children’s unique physical, psychological and social needs. This includes caring for the wellbeing of surviving parents and family members so that they can better look after their children.” UNICEF has provided care and psychosocial support to hundreds of children whose parents or caregivers have fallen ill or died due to Ebola. Such support is critical for children who are especially vulnerable to isolation, stigma, malnutrition or poverty. UNICEF’s experience of responding to previous outbreaks allowed the organization and its partners to deploy its resources and expertise within 48 hours of the outbreak being declared on 1 June 2020. Over the following five and a half months, UNICEF worked closely with local and government partners to improve water and sanitation facilities within the Ebola treatment centres, provide psychosocial support to those infected and affected, including children separated from their caregivers, and strengthen knowledge of the disease and prevention practices within communities. More specifically, UNICEF and its partners have Reached more than 1 million people with life saving information on Ebola symptoms, prevention and treatment Distributed more than half a million litres of clean water to the Ebola treatment centres in the province Provided psychosocial support to 102 Ebola patients in the treatment centres, 288 children with or suspected to have Ebola, 66 survivors, and 387 members of families affected by Ebola Cared for 26 children separated from their caregivers in 3 nurseries Assisted more than 1,000 vulnerable children Produced social science analysis including guidance briefs, perception and behaviour surveys and recommendations to better guide the response Trained government and NGO partners on prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse. UNICEF will continue to reinforce the national health care system to make it more effective in responding to future epidemics. The organization is also working on programs for Ebola survivors in the DRC. In addition, it will work with the local health authorities in Equateur to ensure that mothers and children in the areas previously affected by Ebola continue to receive quality essential health care. This includes improving water and sanitation in health centres, promoting hygiene practices in affected communities, provide psychosocial support to Ebola survivors, as well as children affected by the epidemic. The response to the 11th Ebola epidemic in DRC has been informed by social science studies from the previous Ebola epidemics, which emphasized the need to ensure communities are at the heart of response through targeted risk communication and engagement activities. As a result, communities have shown greater acceptance of the Ebola vaccine thanks to increased trust in health care workers and a better understanding of how the vaccine works, where to get it and what the side effects are.

"Viet Nam News HÀ NỘI — Natural disasters have killed 218 people and caused a total loss of VNĐ20 trillion US 860 million to the country this year. Although the number of fatalities and damage was much lower than both in 2016 and 2017, natural disasters have still caused serious destruction to the country this year. Nguyễn Xuân Cường, Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development cum head of the Central Steering Committee on Natural Disasters Prevention and Control, made the statement at a meeting yesterday. The meeting was organised to summarise the achievements and failures of natural disaster management this year as well as setting tasks for next year. Statistics from the ministry showed that natural disasters killed 386 people and caused damage of nearly VNĐ60 trillion 2.58 billion in 2017. In 2016, 264 people died and damage of nearly VNĐ 40 trillion 1.72 billion was recorded. Speaking at the meeting, deputy head of the committee’s Việt Nam Disaster Management Authority, Nguyễn Trường Sơn, said 13 typhoons, 14 flash floods, four extreme cold spells, 11 heat waves and 30 torrential rain storms along with a series of high tides in southern provinces had been recorded this year. Improvements needed Sơn said although the authority had applied high tech forecasting technology, shortcomings remained. For example, the authority had installed an observation system to warn mountainous areas of torrential rain, applied remote sensing technology in dyke management and piloted a Geotube seawall to prevent salinity in Bến Tre Province, he said. These solutions were new for Việt Nam, and had the potential to prevent natural disasters, he said. However, Sơn added forecasting of torrential rains, flash floods and landslides was still not up to scratch. Sơn gave an example of a landslide that left 18 dead in November in the south central province of Nha Trang. The number of dead could have been much lower if the local administration had seriously implemented forecasting and supervision to mitigate the risks of natural disasters, he said. In the meantime, minister Cường ordered the central steering committee on natural disaster prevention and control as well as localities to conduct an overall inspection of forecasting, warning and remedying natural disasters. Cường also said forecasting centres across the country had been told to check both their equipment and human resources and fix where necessary. — VNS.","['Cold Wave', 'Flash Flood', 'Heat Wave', 'Land Slide', 'Tropical Cyclone']"

" OVERVIEW The 32 countries in the East Asia and the Pacific EAP region have varying levels of development and capacity, as well as exposure and vulnerability to natural hazards. Many countries in the region undergo seasonal periods of increased hydrometeorological activity, experiencing cyclones and monsoon rains that can trigger increased flood and landslide risks. Several EAP countries situated along the Pacific Ring of Fire also experience volcanic activity, earthquakes, and associated tsunamis. In FY 2019, USAID OFDA continued to respond to disasters and support DRR programs that strengthen the capacity of first responders, enhance and expand early warning systems, and increase disaster awareness and improve preparedness among at risk communities. USAID OFDA has focused DRR activities in the EAP region on strategic, context specific programs designed to meet particular risk reduction needs in each country, with capacity building and self reliance as consistent themes across all programs. In FY 2019, USAID OFDA continued this strategic approach by building host nation and local community capacity to prepare for and better respond to disasters through ongoing programs, as well as several new initiatives at both the country and regional levels. Cumulatively, USAID OFDA provided more than 33.6 million in FY 2019 for DRR projects throughout EAP.","['Cold Wave', 'Drought', 'Earthquake', 'Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Tropical Cyclone', 'Tsunami', 'Volcano', 'Wild Fire']"
" Executive Summary The Sierra Leone National Action Plan for Health Security NAPHS is based on the recommendations of the 2016 Joint External Evaluation JEE . The JEE is a voluntary, collaborative and multi sectoral process to evaluate country’s capacity to prevent, detect and rapidly respond to public health risks occurring naturally or due to deliberate or accidental events. The JEE process helps countries identify the most critical gaps within their human and animal health systems, to prioritize opportunities for enhanced preparedness and response, and to engage with current and prospective partners and donors to effectively target resources. Sierra Leone was among first African nations to accept to undergo the JEE process which was conducted in between 31st Oct – 4th November. Some of the key areas for improvement that were identified through the process of JEE included the need for revision of public health laws and legislation, a budget line for IHR, accelerate the implementation of the One Health approach, development of a comprehensive multi hazard National Public Health Emergency Preparedness and Response plan, strengthening surveillance at points of entry PoEs , improve coordination and collaboration between human and animal health laboratory systems, Improve capacity human resources, laboratory for the detection and response to chemical and radiation hazards among several other key priorities. Stakeholders, with broad representation, and using a one health approach, reviewed the NAPHS so as to prioritize activities planned in the 2018 2022 implementation period. A resource mapping exercise was carried out, this allowed the country to have an overview on the available or potential resources to support building country capacities for health security. Implementation of this plan will enable the country to prevent the likelihood and reduce the consequences of outbreaks and other public health hazards build national capacities for early detection and effective response to public health emergencies and other events of public health concern foster all sector partnerships for effective prevention, detection and response to public health emergencies and other events of public health concern establish a sustainable financing strategy for the attainment of national health security. Overall, this will enable the country to strengthen core capacities required under IHR 2005 leading to enhanced health security of the country and the sub region. The overall cost of implementation of this plan is about 291 million, the high prioritized activities for implementation in year one and two will cost about 50 million. It is envisaged that the health sector development partners will be enthusiastic to supplement domestic funding for the implementation to be a success. WHO will continue to coordinate a platform for donors and partners to share, inform, and collaborate in order to strengthen Sierra Leone IHR 2005 capacity and increase our contribution to global health security.","['Epidemic', 'Flood', 'Mud Slide']"
" HIGHLIGHTS Fuel shortages hinder access to food, health care services, and safe drinking water in northern Yemen throughout October Flooding adversely affects nearly 4,300 households across six governorates in late September and early October UN agencies conduct assessment and emergency distribution mission to Durayhimi city KEY DEVELOPMENTS Widespread fuel shortages, which began in mid September due to delayed fuel shipments into Al Hudaydah Port following the implementation of Republic of Yemen Government RoYG regulations on commercial fuel imports, have led to increased fuel prices and long wait times at fuel stations, according to the UN. As a result, relief actors reported adverse impacts on public infrastructure reliant on fuel—particularly water, sanitation, and hygiene WASH infrastructure—limiting access to safe drinking water and impeding vulnerable households’ ability to meet basic needs. While an increase in fuel shipments to Al Hudaydah Port in late October has temporarily alleviated constrained operations at fuel stations, humanitarian organizations remain concerned that shortages could continue in late November without a long term solution. U.S. Government USG partners the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR , the UN World Food Program WFP , and the UN World Health Organization WHO conducted an assessment mission to Al Hudaydah Governorate’s Durayhimi city, which has remained inaccessible since June 2018 due to continued fighting between Al Houthi and RoYG forces. In addition to assessing humanitarian needs, the UN agencies distributed emergency relief items, including food assistance, hygiene kits, medicine, nutrition supplements, and safe drinking water, to the estimated 200 civilians remaining in the city.","['Epidemic', 'Flash Flood']"
" By Sandeep Moudgall BENGALURU Karnataka is staring at serious water crisis with the cabinet on Wednesday deciding to ban the use of water for agriculture purpose in southern and coastal parts of the state. Briefing the media, law minister T B Jayachandra said the cabinet has resolved to stop the release of water for other than drinking purpose in southern interior Karnataka and the coastal districts. We have received a very bleak report from the Meteorological department, which says the state may not receive a good monsoon in the coming months. As a result, water from the dams across the south and coastal parts has been stopped for agriculture purpose, said the minister. He said the cabinet has given four important directions to the administration, including that of embarking on cloud seeding in the south and coastal parts of the state. Barring Almatti and Narayanpura, where water is overflowing, we are seeing a deficit in all other dams. The rains received this monsoon are lower than what was expected and cloud seeding will begin shortly, said Jayachandra. Between June 1 and August 8, the state received 503 mm of rainfall on average, as opposed to the expected 537 mm of rainfall. While north Karnataka had a decent rainfall, the Malnad and coastal regions of the state has received more than 50 per cent less than what was anticipated. The ban for releasing water for agriculture purpose has been imposed in the Kaveri catchment area, with the Krishna Raj Sagar KRS , Harangi and Kabini reporting a deficit in water storage. Ban has also been imposed in the Krishna and Tungabhadra basin as well. The cabinet has asked the agriculture department to mobilise the requisite demands for suggesting alternative crops to farmers, which are less water intensive. It has also asked the RDPR and agriculture department to give more impetus to the Mahatma Gandhi Rural Employment Generation MNREGA scheme to generate employment. More importantly, the cabinet has asked the agriculture department to begin cloud seeding by earmarking close to Rs 30 crore for the purpose. While it is estimated that the actual cloud seeding will cost around Rs 10 to Rs 12 crore, the setting up of radar stations to identify the locations will cost Rs 20 crore. Even in this case, the estimation of success in achieving rainfall is at 30 per cent after cloud seeding, said law minister Jayachandra. The minister said directions have been given to administration to hold meetings with the irrigation councils at the district levels and reach out to the farmers via Irrigation Consultative Committees IRCC to discuss the release of water on a bare minimum basis.","['Drought', 'Heat Wave']"

" UNICEF – in partnership with Gavi and WHO – is also helping low and lower middle income countries prepare to receive COVID 19 vaccines in 2021 NEW YORK, 18 December 2020 – UNICEF could potentially transport up to 850 tonnes of COVID 19 vaccines per month in 2021, should such quantities become available, according to a new assessment. This is more than double the average weight of vaccines UNICEF transports every month. The assessment is part of UNICEF’s work https www.unicef.org supply covax ensuring global equitable access covid 19 vaccines to lead on the procurement and delivery of COVID 19 vaccines for 92 low and lower middle income countries on behalf of the COVAX Facility https www.gavi.org covax facility , in collaboration with the Pan American Health Organization PAHO . “This is a mammoth and historic undertaking,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. “The scale of the task is daunting, and the stakes have never been higher, but we are ready to take this on.” The UNICEF assessment looked at global airfreight capacity and transport routes to better understand the challenges of delivering COVID 19 vaccines in 2021. It found that commercial airlines will be able to deliver vaccines to almost all 92 low and lower middle income countries, which are among the 190 economies participating in the COVAX Facility, at an estimated cost of up to US 70 million. Comparing vaccine volume estimates against commercial and cargo routes across the globe, the assessment also found that current air cargo capacity would be sufficient to make deliveries covering 20 per cent of the population for most of the 92 countries. COVID 19 vaccines are expected to be primarily shipped using existing passenger and cargo flight capacity, although charters or alternative transport options may still be needed for some small countries and others with access issues. UNICEF is working with airlines and the wider logistics industry to prioritise the delivery of COVID 19 vaccines around the world. One major challenge in the COVID 19 vaccine operation is local cold chain capacity for vaccine storage within some low and lower middle income countries. UNICEF, WHO and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, developed a guidance note on supply and logistics https www.technet 21.org en library main 6717 covid 19 vaccination, country readiness and delivery supply and logistics guidance to help countries develop their supply chain strategies to receive, store, distribute and manage COVID 19 vaccines and related products. Given the range of storage temperatures required for COVID 19 vaccines, countries will continue to train logisticians and health workers on how to keep COVID 19 vaccines at the right temperatures. As part of a programme that started in 2017 https www.unicef.org supply stories keeping vaccines safe through last mile their journey , with support from Gavi, UNICEF continues to procure and support the installation of 70,000 cold chain fridges in lower income countries by the end of 2021, which will help in the roll out of COVID 19 vaccines that need to be stored at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius. Almost half of these will be solar powered. UNICEF, WHO and Gavi are also working to help countries prepare and develop national deployment and vaccination plans https www.who.int publications i item WHO 2019 nCoV Vaccine deployment 2020.1 for the large scale roll out of COVID 19 vaccines. Currently, countries are continuing to monitor their readiness https www.technet 21.org en library main 6724 covid 19 virat vraf 2.0 22covid 19 vaccine introduction readiness assessment tool 22 against key milestones, which include expediting regulatory approvals and putting in place ways to monitor vaccine safety. In addition, a UNICEF meeting this week with more than 300 vaccine procurement experts globally, including government officials, looked at ways to procure and roll out COVID 19 vaccines and strengthen regulatory systems and supply chains. Funding is critical. UNICEF has called for US 410 million to help countries with the delivery of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostic tools in 2021. Further, UNICEF estimates a funding gap of US 133 million to cover in country vaccine logistics and the required cold chain equipment for the poorest 92 countries. “With the imminent arrival of globally approved COVID 19 vaccines, we can begin to see signs of hope. But hope will not be restored by the vaccine alone,” said Fore. “Countries need urgent technical and financial support to strengthen their capacities for cold and supply chains, to train health workers, and to work with communities in combatting misinformation and building trust in vaccines. Without urgent funding and support, many of the poorest countries still risk being left behind.” About COVAX COVAX is the vaccines pillar of the ACT Accelerator https eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com ?url https 3A 2F 2Fwww.who.int 2Finitiatives 2Fact accelerator data 04 7C01 7Cmsharafudeen 40gavi.org 7Cd623fb28a41741c76f2b08d8a0dda1d2 7C1de6d9f30daf4df6b9d65959f16f6118 7C0 7C0 7C637436221055741585 7CUnknown 7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0 3D 7C1000 sdata tBdzLnud 2FYE3TGyhSF16kc1SwaKRLxBwRHsf6ZsABaI 3D reserved 0 .

"TNN Jun 6, 2012, 05.14AM IST KOLKATA The relentless heat killed 67 more people across West Bengal on Tuesday, six of them in Kolkata, pushing up the death toll to 86 in just two days. Five prize horses also died despite water and ice therapy. The Met department has warned that it will get worse as the wait for the monsoon stretches to mid June. This is perhaps the highest number of heat related deaths in the state in decades. It doesn't matter if you are 18 and fit as a fiddle or 70 and ailing. The heat has spared none. Alarmed by the worsening weather, the state has extended summer vacations till June 17 by when the rains are expected to have arrived. Three lawyers' associations have decided to stay away from work till Friday. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee convened a cabinet meeting on Tuesday to come to grips with the heat wave. If you have no work in the state secretariat please go to the districts to reach out to the people, the CM told her ministers. Asansol, which sizzled at 46.5 degrees Celsius, suffered the worst. Thirty one people dropped dead during the day, while at least 50 were hospitalized. Twenty one people died in Midnapore. The heat struck so quickly that many succumbed within moments some died at the doorsteps of hospitals. Kolkata had another terrible day in the cauldron as six people died, five of them in Behala Thakurpukur. Three people died at Howrah station soon after arriving by the Amritsar Express and a railway employee died in the welding shed of Liluah workshop.

" Weather situation Hurricane Matthew has impacted Haiti in the area of ​Port à Piment. He then continued his journey North and swept during several hours the departments of Sud and Grande Anse in the South West of the island. Matthew battered Haiti's southwest coast with 145 mile per hour 230 kph winds and surging seas that flooded coastal towns on Tuesday, tearing at trees and rooftops before moving out to sea. Rising sea levels and torrential rains have caused major flooding in southern Haiti since Sunday evening. Fierce winds knocked out communications with the southern part of the island for hours but telephone service is slowly being restored. The eye of the violent Category 4 Hurricane Matthew passed over Haiti's western tip early on Tuesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said, bringing devastating winds, heavy rains and a storm surge with massive waves. It was forecast to remain extremely powerful as it made its way to Cuba and the Bahamas and a hurricane watch was issued for parts of southeast Florida, which the forecasters said Matthew could reach late on Thursday. Situation in the country • The Bridge on Route Nationale 2 is down cutting of the access to the South. It is the only one linking the capital Port au Prince to the southern peninsula. • The coast has been affected In the department of Grande Anse 468,000 inhabitants .

" VANUA LAVA VOLCANO 13°80’S 167°47’E Summit 3021ft 921m Current Vanuatu Volcano Alert Level Level 1 Vanua Lava volcano is continuing in the level of low unrest. The Volcanic Alert Level remains at Level 1 . The Vanua Lava volcanic activity is continuing at the low unrest level, consistent with the Volcanic Alert Level 1. New scientific analyses suggest that the volcanic activity is likely to continue at this same level of minor unrest. Volcanic hazards remain on the volcanic cone and sulfur river e.g. volcanic gases . Danger Zone for life safety is limited around the volcanic cone and the sulfur river. Latest observations and satellite data confirm that there is no significant manifestation and the volcanic activity conditions remain stable. There is an ongoing presence of volcanic gases around the volcanic cone and around the sulfur river. Gas smell will continue while approaching these two areas. The Volcanic Alert Level for Vanua Lava volcano has been at the Level 1 since 27th May 2016. The current observations are consistent with the activity of the Volcanic Alert Level 1. Level 1 indicates ‘Minor level of unrest Danger Zone is near the volcanic area and the sulfur river’ . Vanua Lava volcano is one of the active volcano in Vanuatu and in contrast to other large volcanoes in the country, it does not contain a youthful summit caldera. A chain of small stratovolcanoes, oriented along a NNE SSW line, gives the low angle volcano an irregular profile. Historically, this volcano had low infrequent activity except in XIX 19 century with 3 moderate manifestations and in XX 20 century with 2. All tourism agencies, visitors, local authorities, and people from Vanua Lava Island and general public are reminded that due to the current volcanic activity, the danger zone remains at around the sulfur river and volcano area . In these areas, volcanic gases will always be expected. Visitors may expect impact of this gas while approaching these two areas. The Vanuatu Meteorology and Geohazards Department will closely monitor this volcano activity. More information will be provided accordingly when necessary.

"Glasgow, 10 November 2021 WMO Sea surface temperatures and ocean heat in parts of the South West Pacific are increasing at more than three times the global average rate, with marine heatwaves bleaching once vibrant coral reefs and threatening vital ecosystems upon which the region depends. On land, storms and floods routinely trigger death, destruction and displacement in South East Asia and Pacific Small Island Developing States SIDS whilst extreme heat and a more intense fire season are expected to become a feature of Australia’s climate. Tropical glaciers – the last remaining ones between the Himalayas and the Andes may disappear within five years, according to a new report from the World Meteorological Organization WMO . The State of the Climate in the South West Pacific 2020 provides a snapshot of climate indicators like temperatures, sea level rise, ocean heat and acidification and extreme weather, alongside risks and impacts on economies, society and the environment. It covers much of South East Asia including Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Oceania including Australia, New Zealand and Pacific Islands. It is one of a new series of regional climate reports by WMO and the first of its kind for the region. The report and an accompanying story map https public.wmo.int en our mandate climate wmo statement state of global climate southwestpacific was launched at the United Nations Climate Change negotiations, COP26, on 10 November. The existential threat to many Small Island Developing States SIDS is one of the recurrent themes at COP26, which is described as a make or break effort to achieve the Paris Agreement targets of limiting global temperature increase to a maximum of 2 degrees Celsius above pre industrial levels. “This report highlights the real and potential risks associated with the changes occurring in ocean circulation, temperature, acidification and deoxygenation, as well as rising sea level. The Small Island Developing States are increasingly vulnerable to these changes, as their incomes are highly linked to fisheries, aquaculture and tourism,” said WMO Secretary General Prof. Petteri Taalas. “Over land areas, the significant and growing impacts of extreme hydrometeorological phenomena and tropical cyclones, plus new multi dimensional threats, pose increasing challenges to communities in the region. The COVID 19 pandemic has disrupted socio economic development in the region, affecting key drivers of growth and revealing gaps in countries’ capacities for addressing systemic and cascading risk,” said Prof. Taalas. Key messages Temperatures In the South West Pacific region, 2020 was the second or third warmest year on record, depending on the data set. A cooling La Niña event developed in the second half of 2020, but this is likely to have a greater impact on 2021 temperatures. Sea surface temperatures are an important physical indicator of Earth’s climate system. The ocean area of the South West Pacific region is influenced by natural phenomena such as El Niño La Niña as well as human induced climate change. Between 1982 2020, ocean surface temperatures in the Tasman Sea and in the west of the Timor Sea increased at three times the global average rate. Ocean warming The ocean absorbs more than 90 of the excess heat from human activities. Since 1993, the global rate of ocean warming has likely more than doubled, and it will continue throughout this century. In parts of the South West Pacific region, ocean heat content has increased more than three times faster than the global average rate. In 2020, the Great Barrier Reef region of Australia suffered a major heatwave. In February, sea surface temperatures over the region were 1.2 °C above the 1961–1990 average, making it the hottest month on record. High temperatures affected the entire reef and widespread coral bleaching was reported, the third mass bleaching event in the past five years. If global temperature rises 2 °C above pre industrial levels, there is a risk that 90 of the coral reefs in the Coral Triangle and the Great Barrier Reef could face severe degradation. Ocean warming, deoxygenation and acidification are changing the oceans’ circulation pattern and chemistry. Fish and zooplankton are migrating to higher latitudes and changing behaviours. Consequently, traditional fisheries are altering. This has critical implications for the Pacific islands where coastal fishing is a principal activity that provides for nutrition, welfare, culture and employment. Between 1990 and 2018, total fisheries production has decreased by as much as 75 in Vanuatu, 23 in Tonga and 15 in New Caledonia. Sea level rise Global mean sea level has risen at an average rate of about 3.3 mm per year since the start of satellite records in the early 1990s and has accelerated as a result of ocean warming and land ice melt. The North Indian Ocean and in the western part of the tropical Pacific Ocean, the rates of sea level change are substantially higher than the global mean rise, mainly due to geographical variations in thermal expansion. Sea level is also dependent on natural phenomena such as ENSO. Sea level rise is already having a major impact on society, economies and ecosystems in Pacific Islands. It also increases vulnerability to tropical cyclones, storm surge and coastal flooding. Tropical Glaciers The glaciers near Puncak Jaya, in Papua, Indonesia 4 884 m are last remaining tropical glaciers between the Himalayas and the Andes, and have existed for around 5 000 years. At the current rate, total ice loss will be expected within the next five years – especially if there is a strong warming El Niño event. Extreme weather Storms and floods have historically been the most devastating extreme weather events in the region. The Philippines and Small Island Developing States have suffered greatly from regular typhoons tropical cyclones. Droughts are also a major hazard. In April 2020, category 5 Tropical Cyclone Harold led to extensive human and economic damage in the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji and Tonga. The Philippines was devastated by consecutive tropical cyclones during October and November 2020. Typhoon Goni Rolly had one of the most intense landfalls of any tropical cyclone on record when it reached the Philippines on 30 October. The unprecedented 2019–2020 wildfire season in eastern Australia led to severe smoke pollution. More than 10 million hectares were burned, 33 people were killed, more than 3 000 homes were destroyed and millions of animals died. In January, Western Sydney, reached 48.9 °C – the highest temperature on record for any major Australian metropolitan area, and Canberra reached 44.0 °C – more than one degree above the city’s previous record. Australian land areas have warmed by around 1.4°C since 1910 – above the global average. Impacts of extreme weather Weather related hazards continue to threaten the sustainable development of countries in the South West Pacific and many of these are expected to become more extreme as a result of climate change. An increase in the intensity of typhoons is likely in regions of the western North Pacific near the Philippines. Between 2000 and 2019, about 1 500 fatalities occurred, and close to 8 million people were affected, during extreme weather events per year on average in the region. In 2020, there were about 500 fatalities, about one third of the long term annual average, but more than 11 million people were affected, mainly by tropical cyclones. The Philippines and Indonesia typically report large numbers of affected people from extreme weather events. However, Pacific islands suffer disproportionately when the size of the population is taken into consideration. In Vanuatu and Fiji, more than one fifth of their populations were affected in 2020 by tropical cyclones. The average annual loss AAL from extreme weather events across the South West Pacific is estimated to be US 28.1 billion in Indonesia, US 19.6 billion in the Philippines, US 14.8 billion in Australia and US 7.1 billion in Malaysia. When the size of the economy is considered, the estimated AAL is as high as 17.9 of GDP for Vanuatu, 14.6 of GDP for Tonga and 7.7 of GDP for the Federated States of Micronesia. Adaptation and Resilience Early Warning Systems are a key adaptation measure to reduce climate related risks and impacts. About three quarters of countries in South West Pacific have a multi hazard early warning system in place, representing approximately 73 000 in 100 000 people. Activities under the Climate Risk and Early Warning System CREWS initiative are seeking to strengthen this further. Addressing the rising climate risks and associated impacts requires local, regional and transnational capacity building, development of climate services and integrated disaster risk reduction approaches. These constitute foundational elements for achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and building back better from the COVID 19 pandemic The World Meteorological Organization is the United Nations System’s authoritative voice on Weather, Climate and Water For further information contact Clare Nullis, media officer.

" MANAGUA PANAMA CITY, March 11 . Almost four months after the passing of powerful hurricanes Eta and Iota in Nicaragua, about 500,000 people including many children are still affected by limited access to water, hygiene and sanitation facilities in the Northern Caribbean Coast, said today UNICEF Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean, Jean Gough, when wrapping up a 6 day field visit to affected communities. On the ground, tangible progress has been made by the government of Nicaragua and other humanitarian partners to respond to the immediate needs and rebuild damaged infrastructure such as schools, housing and water facilities. However, the start of the dry season highlights the rising and urgent need to support Nicaragua and accelerate the efforts to improve sustainable access to drinkable water, food, protection, education, health and livelihoods even in the most remote areas. UNICEF’s Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean visited Nicaragua and assessed the progress of UNICEF’s humanitarian response in the communities of Kiwastara, Andre along the Coco river in the Waspam municipality and Wawa Bar, Karatá in the municipality of Puerto Cabezas. “The level of destruction left by these two mighty hurricanes one after the other goes beyond our imagination. Boats drifted hundreds of meters away from the shore, trees were smashed like matchsticks and roofs were lifted up by destructive sea currents, winds and rain,” said Jean Gough. “Over the next few months, families affected by the hurricanes can no longer rely on the rain as a source of safe water. Limited access to drinkable water may expose children to increased risks of diarrhoea and malnutrition in the coming weeks.” About 1,8 million people, including 720,000 children are still in need of humanitarian aid, especially among the indigenous communities of the North Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua. Girls, boys and adolescents are among the most affected and the most invisible, with immediate and long term effects derived from the climate emergency. More than 260 schools lost their roofs and have been partially damaged or totally destroyed. In the aftermath of the hurricanes, UNICEF immediately provided humanitarian assistance to affected girls, boys, adolescents and families in the southern and northern coasts of Nicaragua, especially those in conditions of greater vulnerability, focusing on water and sanitation, nutrition, education in emergencies, protection, and psychosocial support, including 18,000 hygiene kits have been distributed to families 300 wells and tanks have been set up or cleaned up 476 latrines have been built or refurbished at the community and school levels 6,150 cleaning kits with soap and buckets have been provided to schools 11,000 school backpacks have been distributed to affected children so they can return to schools 12 temporary learning spaces have been set up while schools are being repaired to enable 7,500 children to keep learning On the ground, I saw roofless schools being repaired, contaminated wells being refurbished. Reconstruction efforts are clearly underway. Amidst this tragic situation, I witnessed how a simple school backpack can put a smile on the face of a child and light up hope among the entire community. But beyond learning, going back to school also helped these families in the most remote areas to overcome the trauma and regain a sense of normalcy though their own children,” said Jean Gough. UNICEF also recognizes the decision by the government of Nicaragua to keep schools open last year and resume the face to face school year last month, even in the areas affected by the twin hurricanes. “It’s unfair that children from the poorest communities in Nicaragua are the least responsible for climate change, yet they are bearing the greatest burden of its impact,” explained Jean Gough. “This is not the first hurricane to hit the Caribbean Coast of Nicaragua and unfortunately, it’s not going to be the last. Families living in the most exposed areas need to get better prepared in the face of extreme weather events, before the next hurricane season starts. One of our greatest challenges now is to search for innovative, scalable and sustainable solutions to quickly reduce risks and build resilience at home, in the school and for every child.” Last year, UNICEF made an emergency appeal for more than 17 million US to provide humanitarian assistance to 430,000 people, including 120,000 children. So far, UNICEF has only received 47 per cent of the funding needed. UNICEF is grateful to the international donors generously contributing to its humanitarian response in Nicaragua, including USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, the Government of Japan and the European Union’s department for Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid ECHO . UNICEF is urgently calling on the international community to bolster its financial support to the children of Nicaragua in improving their access to education, nutrition, protection, water and sanitation.

"Following the massive floods caused by Typhoon Ulysses international name Vamco in northern Luzon, World Vision firms up its relief aid distributions in the provinces of Cagayan and Isabela. “We confirm our intention to support our fellow people in Isabela and Cagayan. We are deeply concerned on the well being of so many affected families, especially the children, as they cope from the overwhelming floods last week in the north,” World Vision national director Rommel Fuerte shares. Typhoon Ulysses brought heavy rains last November 12 and caused the swelling of rivers and water reservoirs, prompting the Magat Dam authorities to open its gates and release water, which further inundated several towns of the two provinces. The flooding has also been attributed to the limited capacity of the soil to absorb rainfall after being saturated by succeeding typhoons prior to Ulysses. The National Disaster Risk and Management Council NDRRMC, Nov 17 reports there are over 79,000 families from 366 villages in Cagayan and more than 69,000 families in Isabela directly affected by the typhoon. The two hardest hit provinces combined also incurred about P115.86 million damage and losses in agriculture. The massive destruction to farmlands and disruption to livelihoods could affect many parents’ ability to provide for the basic needs of their children. This could trigger food insecurity, and eventually malnutrition among children,” says Fuerte. “We urge everyone to support all humanitarian efforts so that we can reach more of our 'kababayans' in the North. World Vision also calls on the local government units LGUs to ensure that safety measures are in place to avoid the spread of COVID 19, especially in the evacuation centers. In partnership with the LGUs and the community based organizations including Pangkaunlaran and Green Meadows, World Vision hopes to cover hard hit areas. World Vision also currently implements relief operations in the battered Catanduanes as part of its response in the Bicol Region, in the aftermath of super typhoon Rolly international name Goni .","['Epidemic', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Tropical Cyclone']"

II. Relevant developments 3 . Efforts to reinvigorate the peace negotiations slowed following the postponement of a proposed high level conference in Istanbul, Turkey, highlighting the need for a renewed commitment by the parties to fully and constructively engage in talks. With the announcements by the United States of America and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO on the withdrawal of their remaining military forces by September 2021, the Taliban stated that they would defer their attendance of any high level events until such time. Efforts to foster unity around the peace process by the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan faced difficulties, while the Government attempted to promote greater regional consensus on intra Afghan peace and reconciliation, economic cooperation and connectivity. Calls continued for a more inclusive peace process as well as the preservation of fundamental rights and freedoms. Security incidents remained at high levels, with the number of civilian casualties increasing by 29 per cent in the first quarter of 2021 in comparison with the same period in 2020. Ongoing violence, natural disasters and heightened levels of food insecurity contributed to increased suffering, further compounded by the coronavirus disease COVID 19 pandemic.","['Drought', 'Epidemic', 'Flash Flood', 'Flood']"
" excerpt Indonesia The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs today said that the Indonesian Government has confirmed that 1,234 people have died following the earthquake and tsunami in Sulawesi last week. Some 100 people are still missing and 800 have been seriously injured. It is likely that these figures will increase as more areas become accessible. The United Nations Resident Coordinator in Indonesia, Anita Nirody, said that the Government has significant experience and capacity to manage natural disasters, but given the scale and complexity of this emergency, combined with the response to the recent series of earthquakes in Lombok and the residual needs there, United Nations agencies and non‑governmental organizations NGOs are working closely with Government ministries to provide all necessary technical support. United Nations agencies and others are already on the ground or are en route to the affected areas to provide assistance and to assess what is needed. The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says that needs are vast, and people urgently require shelter, clean water, food, fuel, emergency medical care and psychosocial support. Water remains the main issue as most of the water supply infrastructure has been damaged. As mentioned in yesterday’s briefing, the Government has welcomed specific offers of international assistance that are in line with identified humanitarian needs on the ground. For its part, the United Nations Children’s Fund UNICEF is concerned for the safety of thousands of children in the wake of the disaster, which is affecting a vulnerable population, particularly vulnerable children. The Indonesian Ministry of Social Affairs has requested UNICEF to deploy social workers to the affected area to support separated and unaccompanied children. The World Health Organization WHO , which is coordinating closely with the Ministry of Health, is warning that the lack of shelter and damaged water sanitation facilities could lead to outbreaks of diarrhoea and other communicable diseases. The World Food Programme WFP is supporting the Government in distributing emergency supplies. The WFP‑operated United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot in Subang Jaya, Malaysia, is on standby for aid partners who want to release stocks.","['Earthquake', 'Tsunami']"
"Fiji is bracing for Cyclone Yasa, which is predicted to intensify into a powerful category 5 severe tropical cyclone on Thursday, making it the largest to affect Fiji since Cyclone Winston in 2016. Cyclone Yasa is expected to bring destructive winds in excess of 220km h as it moves across the island nation. Modelling has the cyclone tracking across Viti Levu, the largest and most populous island in Fiji with the possibility that it could affect the two largest cities Nadi and Suva as well as a number of other islands. Save the Children teams are monitoring the storm closely and stand ready to support the Government of Fiji to respond. The aid agency has stockpiles of aid including shelter, hygiene and education kits in key locations across the country. “Cyclone Yasa will bring heavy rain, powerful winds and potential storm surge which is particularly dangerous for low lying coastal communities,” said Save the Children Fiji’s CEO, Shairana Ali. “The cyclone could have harmful impacts on children, both in terms of their physical and emotional wellbeing. “Save the Children teams are ready to do whatever is needed to support affected children and families.” This comes as Fiji is battling the devastating impacts of coronavirus on their economy, which is having a significant impact on children and their families. Cyclone Yasa formed earlier this week between Vanuatu and Fiji. Save the Children has a long history responding to emergencies in Fiji, including the previous category 5 Cyclone Winston.

"KABUL, AFGHANISTAN FEBRUARY 12, 2012 – International Organizations and aid groups funded by USAID have begun distributing emergency winter aid to vulnerable migrant populations in camps in areas surrounding Kabul. The aid, distributed by a task force led by the U.N. Office for the Coordinator for Humanitarian Affairs OCHA , includes blankets, tarpaulins, clothing, stoves, and fuel. USAID, working through implementing partners Save The Children and the International Organization for Migration, distributed additional supplies to fill any gaps left by OCHA's distribution. The distribution of supplies has concentrated on the most vulnerable populations housed in 40 informal settlements in 10 of Kabul's districts. The populations are primarily displaced persons from Helmand and Kunduz provinces, as well as returned refugee populations from Iran and Pakistan. Partners in the distribution efforts include the U.S. Department of State's Bureau for Population, Refugees and Migration State PRM , the USAID Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance USAID OFDA , the International Organization for Migration, and the U.N. High Commission for Refugees UNHCR . The distribution of emergency winter aid covers 100 percent of the informal settlements in Kabul. The distribution of emergency winter aid is part of a larger U.S. Government assistance package of some 44 million in humanitarian assistance for FY2012 for Afghans affected by conflict and natural disasters. This aid includes nearly 10 million in relief commodities and economic recovery through USAID’s Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, over 27 million in emergency food assistance through USAID's Office of Food for Peace, including 20 million through the World Food Program to purchase over 15,000 metric tons of food commodities. In addition, State PRM has provided over 7 million in humanitarian assistance, livelihood support, and protection interventions for Afghans, including Afghan refugees who have returned to Afghanistan from Iran and Pakistan. Emergency winter aid distribution and ongoing support for returned refugees and other vulnerable populations remains a key component of USG assistance to Afghanistan.","['Cold Wave', 'Snow Avalanche']"
" Overview Matthew 16 is a category 4 tropical cyclone moving northwest, over the Caribbean Sea, with winds reaching 220 km h. Tropical cyclone Matthew will remain powerful through Monday night, the 3rd of October 2016, when it is predicted to approach southwestern Haiti and Jamaica. The tropical cyclone is then expected to reach Cuba on Tuesday afternoon, the 4th of October 2016 USNHC . Along with strong winds, rain accumulation is also predicted to cause adverse effects—such as flash floods, mud slides, and storm surges—in Haiti, Cuba, and Jamaica. Southern Haiti is expected to accumulate 380 to 640 mm of rainfall, western Haiti is expected to receive 200 to 300 mm, and northern Haiti is expected to receive 30 to 80 mm. 250 to 510 mm is predicted over eastern Jamaica and eastern Cuba CDEMA Operational Plan for tropical Cyclone Matthew . The most likely scenario forecasts tropical cyclone Matthew’s center to pass over the western tip of Haiti as a category 4 cyclone. This may result in significant wind and flood damages in Haiti and Jamaica. Precarious and well constructed homes may experience extreme damages and lose roofs, trees may break or uproot causing road blockages, and electricity and water may be unavailable for several days to weeks after tropical cyclone Matthew passes. The cyclone’s current travel speed is a mere 7 km h and could be just as slow when leaving, giving it more time to cause damage Reuters . Haiti is especially vulnerable to floods because of steep terrain and few trees to hold rainfall. Based on data of the observed and predicted tropical cyclone path, wind speeds, and population data from WorldPop acquired on the 3rd of October 2016, UNITAR UNOSAT conducted a population exposure analysis for Haiti, Cuba, and Jamaica In Haiti, 213,827 people are living within 120km h wind zones, 792,920 people are living within 90km h wind zones, and 8,880,729 people are living within 60km h wind zones. In Cuba, 357,154 people are living within 120km h wind zones, 1,242,420 people are living within 90km h wind zones, and 2,683,681 people are living within 60km h wind zones.

" Nearly 10,000 children fleeing floods in the area AMMAN, 3 January 2019 – Children continue to pay the heaviest price due to the escalation in violence in northwest Syria. UNICEF received alarming reports of 80 people killed, including one child. Many families are fleeing their homes as conflict intensifies, with no place to go but to already overcrowded camps hosting displaced families. Floods swept through the area on 26 December, affecting nearly 10,000 children in Atmeh, Qah, Deir Ballut, Albab, Jisr Ashughur among other areas. Exposed to harsh winter weather and freezing temperature conditions, children’s lives are hanging by a thread. The number of impacted children will increase if fighting continues and as more heavy rain is expected. Many of those children have been displaced, some multiple times. “The suffering of children in northwest Syria has tripled due to this recent escalation of violence, harsh weather conditions and lack of safe refuge. UNICEF calls on all parties fighting in the area and elsewhere in Syria to protect children at all times and allow humanitarian workers to reach children and families in need with lifesaving supplies,” said Geert Cappelaere, Regional Director of UNICEF in the Middle East and North Africa. UNICEF, with partners on the ground, continues to respond to the increasing needs of children and their families. Just today, UNICEF was able to send 13 trucks with lifesaving supplies to the area. The trucks were loaded with winter clothes, plastic sheets, fuel for heating, micronutrient supplies, high energy biscuits, Oral Rehydration Solution ORS and tents for temporary classrooms. UNICEF’s partners on the ground are also monitoring health, nutrition and sanitation needs to prevent an outbreak of diseases.

"Lebanese authorities have spent the past year shamelessly obstructing victims’ quest for truth and justice following the catastrophic port explosion in Beirut, said Amnesty International ahead of the one year anniversary of the blast. More than 217 people were killed and 7,000 injured when 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate exploded in Beirut’s port on 4 August 2020. The blast displaced 300,000 people and caused widespread destruction and devastation, damaging buildings up to 20km away. Throughout the year, the Lebanese authorities’ relentless efforts to shield officials from scrutiny have repeatedly hampered the course of the investigation. Authorities dismissed the first judge appointed to the investigation after he summoned political figures for questioning, and have so far rejected the new investigative judge’s requests to lift MPs’ immunity and to question senior members of the security forces in connection with the tragedy. “The Beirut blast, one of the largest non nuclear explosions in history, inflicted widespread devastation and caused immense suffering. Lebanese authorities promised a swift investigation instead they have brazenly blocked and stalled justice at every turn, despite a tireless campaign for justice and criminal accountability by survivors and families of victims,” said Lynn Maalouf, Deputy Director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International. “The Lebanese government tragically failed to protect the lives of its people, just as it has failed for so long to protect basic socio economic rights. In blocking the judge’s attempts to summon political officials, the authorities have struck yet another blow to the people of Lebanon. Given the scale of this tragedy, it is astounding to see how far the Lebanese authorities are prepared to go to shield themselves from scrutiny.” As the first anniversary of the blast approaches, deeply traumatized residents of Beirut are still reeling from its catastrophic impact. Mireille Khoury, whose 15 year old son Elias died of injuries sustained in the explosion, described the horrific events of that day to Amnesty International “The day of 4 August seemed like the end of the world. We thought it was just a fire… I passed out and then woke up to find my house in ruins. My daughter asked me what happened. She was injured and I was injured too. I rushed outside and found my son on the staircase injured and covered with blood… On that day, they ruined our lives,” she said “If Lebanese authorities allow this crime to pass without accountability, they will go down in history in the most horrendous manner,” she said, adding that she believes an international investigation is the only means to deliver justice. Leaked official documents indicate that Lebanese customs, military and security authorities, as well as the judiciary, had warned successive governments of the dangerous stockpile of explosive chemicals at the port on at least 10 occasions in the past six years, yet no action was taken. The President also stated that he had knowledge of the danger but had “left it to the port authorities to address.” Despite this, MPs and officials have been claiming their right to immunity throughout the investigation. This tactic has been used repeatedly in a decades long context of post conflict amnesty in Lebanon, effectively shielding suspected perpetrators of serious crimes under international law, and denying thousands of victims any form of acknowledgment, let alone justice. Obstruction of justice On 10 December 2020, Judge Fadi Sawan, the first investigative judge appointed, charged former Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil, former Public Works ministers Youssef Fenianos and Ghazi Zeaiter, and caretaker Prime Minister Hassan Diab, with criminal “negligence.” All refused to appear before the judge. Hassan Diab decried the decision as a violation of the constitution. Ghazi Zeaiter and Ali Hassan Khalil filed a lawsuit with the Court of Cassation to remove Judge Sawan from the investigation, citing immunity for MPs from criminal prosecution. In response, Judge Sawan suspended the investigation on 17 December 2020 for nearly two months. Shortly afterwards on 18 February 2021, Lebanon’s Court of Cassation dismissed Judge Sawan. The decision to remove Judge Sawan was received with great anger by the families of victims, who took to the streets condemning political interference in the probe. On 2 July 2021, the new judge assigned to the case, Judge Tarek Bitar, submitted a request to parliament to lift parliamentary immunity for MPs Ali Hasan Khalil, Ghazi Zeaiter and Nouhad Machnouk, along with several other high ranking officials. In response, 26 MPs from the blocs of Speaker of Parliament Nabih Berri, Amal Movement, Hezbollah, and Future Movement, signed a petition requesting the launch of a parallel proceedings in an attempt to avoid interrogation by Judge Bitar. Six MPs later withdrew their signatures, following the outcry on social media from victims’ families and civil society activists. In a separate move, the Minister of Interior rejected a request by Judge Bitar to question the head of General Security, Abbas Ibrahim, one of the country’s top generals. The judge is appealing the decision. In recent more positive moves, both the Beirut and Tripoli bar associations have lifted immunities from officials who are also lawyers – but parliamentary immunities, to date, remain in place. Granting immunity to political officials directly contradicts Lebanon’s obligations under the UN 2016 Minnesota Protocol which aims to protect the right to life and advance justice, accountability for unlawful deaths. The protocol identifies a potentially unlawful death as occurring “where the State may have failed to meet its obligations to protect life”. In such cases, states have a duty to hold perpetrators accountable, and impunity stemming from “political interference” or “blanket amnesties” directly contradicts that duty. Amnesty International stands with families of victims in calling on Lebanese authorities to immediately lift all immunities granted to officials, regardless of their role or position. In June, Amnesty International wrote to the UN Human Rights Council http www.amnesty.org en documents mde18 4284 2021 en with a coalition of over 50 Lebanese and international organizations, calling for an international investigative mission, such as a one year fact finding mission, into the Beirut blast. The letter highlighted the procedural and systemic flaws which prevent Lebanonfrom meeting its international obligations to provide redress to victims. “The weeks of protests by survivors and families of victims are a stark reminder of what is at stake. Their pain and anger have been exacerbated as, time and time again, authorities obstruct their right to truth and justice,” said Lynn Maalouf. “The UN Human Rights Council must heed their call and urgently set up an investigative mechanism to identifywhether conduct by the state caused or contributed to the unlawful deaths,and what steps need to be taken to ensure an effective remedy to victims. .",['Technological Disaster']
"Six years of conflict in Eastern Ukraine has inflicted enormous damage to critical civilian infrastructure. Many key facilities responsible for maintaining the life and well being of local communities have been hit, as well as those which exist to protect civilians from disaster risks. In 2020, more than five million people still suffer from the impact of the fighting. The COVID 19 pandemic exacerbates an already difficult situation. To reduce vulnerability to disaster risk in Eastern Ukraine, IMPACT Initiatives, Right to Protection, the Danish Red Cross, the Austrian Red Cross and the Ukrainian Red Cross Society have come together under the leadership of ACTED to form the 3P Consortium. Since 2019, ACTED and its partners are committed to improving the understanding and management of disaster risk in conflict affected areas. This has meant increasing the preparedness of communities, improving water safety, and improving disaster risk management coordination amongst aid actors and local authorities. Under the water, sanitation and hygiene component of the 3P Consortium’s work, ACTED conducts water safety risk analysis and develops water safety plans jointly with local stakeholders, providing material support towards the realization of these safety plans, with the aim to reduce water safety risks faced by communities in Eastern Ukraine. The Consortium aims to reach 150,000 people through the development of hazard risk reduction plans covering the targeted areas.",['Epidemic']
" CARE teams provide relief in Nepal, India, and Bangladesh Geneva, August 18, 2017. As massive flood waters sweep through the countries of Nepal, India, and Bangladesh, CARE is assisting affected people in all three countries with relief supplies. CARE teams have dispatched food, water, shelter materials, hygiene kits and household supplies to areas where people sought shelter and safety. Overall, approximately 16 million people have been affected across Nepal, India and Bangladesh. “In Bangladesh 4.8 million people in 26 districts are affected by the floods. The country’s situation is unprecedented, perhaps the worst in over 100 years. And it is likely to worsen with more places to get inundated soon”, says Zia Choudhury, Country Director for CARE Bangladesh. “People have taken refuge in government shelters with many more marooned on rooftops, highlands and any other raised structures. Food, safe drinking water and medicine have become a critical needs.” As water is moving downstream from India and Nepal, more districts are expected to be flooded in the coming days. Already, river levels in Bangladesh are higher than usual during a monsoon season and CARE teams prepare for a large scale emergency, distributing shelter materials and food to people who have lost everything. In India, heavy rains have triggered massive floods in several states. “The situation in the villages in the state of Assam is extremely grim. Embankment of rivers in many areas have been breached forcing over 400 families to stay in extremely unhygienic conditions. Most people have lost everything including important documents. Schools are submerged under eight feet of water. Overall, the flood survivors are very worried and in dire need of support”, says Ravikant Upadhyay, Team Leader, Assam Flood Response, of CARE India. CARE India teams are supporting 3,000 people in Assam with dignity and hygiene kits. More support, especially clothes for women, sanitary items and special care for pregnant women and lactating mothers is urgently needed. As women have to venture out long distances to find dry places to defecate, they face a high risk of abuse and violence. CARE teams in Nepal started to distribute relief supplies and will be reaching over 5,600 people with critical food, household items, shelter materials and supplies for mothers of new born babies in the coming days. “We were neck deep in the water in our village and we have not much to eat at the moment. We can resist hunger but our children cannot”, says Binod Chaudhary, a 32 year old man from Kailali district. Climate change is magnifying and exacerbating the current flooding in South Asia. Monsoon rains are becoming more extreme and precipitation patterns are changing, which is simultaneously increasing the prevalence of poverty. CARE will scale up its response to this devastating flooding during the weeks ahead while also continuing to work on the longer term strengthening of the communities to withstand future shocks.","['Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Mud Slide']"
" 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Papua New Guinea has experienced noticeably below average rainfall since October 2014, causing drought conditions across large swathes of the country and affecting at least 2.4 million people. Due to the current El Niño weather event, this pattern of reduced rainfall is predicted to last at least through January 2016. Save the Children carried out a rapid drought needs assessment in East Sepik province from 14 21 October 2015 with the aim of understanding the current situation and impact of the drought, particularly in the Save the Children operational areas in the districts of Wewak, Angoram and Gawi. Nine villages were assessed in six sectors Child Protection, Education, Food Security and Livelihoods FSL , Health, Nutrition and Water, Sanitation and Hygiene WASH . Access to sufficient quantity and quality of water was expressed as the priority need in all nine of the assessed villages. Water levels in both rivers streams and wells were found to be significantly lower than previous dry seasons and the consumption of contaminated water is a great concern. Increases in cases of diarrhea, skin disease and Pertussis since the onset of the drought were reported, with most communities choosing self treatment or Village Health Volunteer VHV service due to lack of health facilities in the assessed area. Lack of access to water was also found to be negatively impacting education and child protection as many schools have either closed completely or drastically reduced their hours due to water shortages. Children are therefore forced to either travel increased distances to reach schools in neighbouring villages or are engaged in food and water collection for their household. At present, the impact of the drought on food security and livelihoods was found to be more significant in the flood plain marsh livelihood zone due largely to their reliance on smaller rivers and streams. Negative coping strategies, including eating less preferred food, lower meal consumption and increasing children’s involvement in labour, is apparent across the assessed area. Given the difference in normal livelihood strategies, current access to nutritious food, access to markets and transportation routes and especially access to water, the “localised” impact of the current drought needs to be taken into consideration. Cases of malnutrition and under nutrition in children aged 6 59 months were similarly clustered in especially vulnerable locations. The nutritional status of children is expected to deteriorate over the next few months if the El Niño related drought continues. Key Recommendations immediate 1. Priority actions include the provision of water purification kits – including a jerry can with a tap and sufficient Aquatabs for a family for a month accompanied by training and hygiene awareness raising at the household and community level. 2. Initiate awareness raising on acute malnutrition and nutrition education at the community level, especially for pregnant and lactating women. Focus on the prevention of malnutrition, especially for children under two years, through health and hygiene messaging and promotion of locally available nutritious foods coconuts, fish seafood, groundnuts, etc. . 3. Deployment of a mobile medical team to reinforce the existing health system, and identify and treat any emerging health issues, especially in remote areas. 4. Monthly monitoring of the nutrition and food security situation is needed over the next 3 6 months in order to identify any significant deterioration in the situation. 5. Support and build capacities of the Department of Education DoE to lead the coordination of education interventions addressing the negative impact of the drought on the education system.","['Cold Wave', 'Drought']"
"Tens of thousands of children in Sub Saharan Africa have been forced out of school or seen the start of their academic year delayed after heavy floods drove them from their homes and destroyed classrooms, Save the Children said today. The organisation is urging governments to step up repair work on schools and provide temporary classrooms for children who had to flee so that they do not fall behind even further following the devastating impact of COVID 19 on their education. Governments also urgently need to set up alternative shelter for families who have taken refuge in schools.

Hundreds of people were killed, hundreds of thousands were left homeless ii https www.savethechildren.net news tens thousands forced out school floods sub saharan africa edn2 and crops were destroyed. Recent floods in Nigeria http floodlist.com africa nigeria floods kogi september 2020 and Guinea http floodlist.com africa guinea floods kankan september 2020 have forced even more people from their homes and more children out of school. Tchima, 48, from Niger, whose village was in the path of the floodwaters, described the devastation We have nothing left now. The houses collapsed and the water took everything away we don't know what to do. I live in a small room with three other females, including my newborn baby granddaughter. Many schools across the region are no longer in use because they have been flooded, destroyed or used as shelters. In Sudan and Niger alone, 116 schools have been damaged over the past two months. The floods mean extra barriers to education, in areas where rising hunger, ongoing conflict, and the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic have already affected children's learning. Countries across the region aimed to reopen their schools in September for the first time since the pandemic hit, but the floods prevented that. In Sudan, the government announced https www.dabangasudan.org en all news article new sudan school year postponed for two months that schools would have to stay closed for an additional two months. In Niger, the government announced that schools could not open until mid October. 10 year old Yasmin from Somalia said I was thrilled to be learning again, seeing my friends and teachers, but after only three weeks, we had floods that forced our school to shut again. This is really sad. Children in other regions of Somalia are learning and gaining valuable knowledge while I'm hungry and struggling on the outskirt of the town. Eric Hazard, Save the Children's Pan African Advocacy Director, said The floods are devastating children's education. The scale of the damage will prevent thousands of children from going back to school any time soon. We know from experience that it takes quite some time to repair schools, and many of these children have already missed months of education because of COVID 19. The longer children are out of school, the less likely it is they'll return they are put to work instead, or run the risk of being married off. Several countries in the region are prone to flooding, but we are seeing more frequent and more deadly floods across the region a real impact of climate change, Hazard added. It's vital that governments, with national and international partners, increase funding to ensure that children have access to the right distance learning. By investing in low tech, inclusive and affordable distance education, we can protect the futures of all children including the most marginalised. In response to the floods, Save the Children is supporting children and their families with healthcare, nutrition and referrals for further medical treatment. The organisation is also providing educational support , boosting water purification and supplying household kits to families who have lost everything. Notes to editors Before the COVID 19 crisis, Sub Saharan Africa already had the highest rates of exclusion from education, with more than one fifth of children aged 6 11 years out of school COVID 19 has led to nationwide closure of schools across all countries in Africa, with over 262 million children out of lessons Children out of school are at greater risk of being abused and exploited or recruited into child labour or, by force, into armed groups. Girls are less likely to return to school once lessons start again and many become victims of child marriage Every year, around 75 million children see their education interrupted.

"RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA The King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre “KSrelief” announced today that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will provide USD 10 million to contribute to addressing the existing threats arising from the oil tanker, Safer , which is anchored off the Red Sea coast north of the Yemeni port city of Al Hudaydah. In a press release, KSrelief states that the Kingdom has always supported the United Nations’ efforts to act to avoid the economic, humanitarian, and environmental threats posed by the tanker an oil spill resulting from further deterioration of the “Safer” has the potential to cause a major environmental and navigational disaster that would cause widespread damage to the Red Sea coast. Fishing communities, international navigation and the delivery by ship of food, fuel and lifesaving supplies to Yemen would all be impacted, exacerbating the humanitarian situation in the region and threatening all Red Sea countries. KSrelief stressed in its statement that the Kingdom has repeatedly warned the international community that the world would face a significant environmental disaster should the oil in the tanker leak into the Red Sea. The “Safer” tanker contains more than one million barrels of oil, and has not been maintained since 2015. Any leakage would threaten regional marine life, fisheries, and biodiversity. KSrelief added that on 8 June 2022, which marked the United Nations’ “World Ocean Day”, concerned parties highlighted the need for urgent collective action to protect the world’s oceans, which are a major global food source as well as a being a key factor in facing the challenges resulting from climate change. The Kingdom is following international developments in this regard within the framework of its broader focus upon the preservation of the most important global marine resources and ecosystems. In order to maintain stability in Yemen and in support of UN efforts to reach solutions to all threats to international peace and security, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, represented by KSrelief, has held several meetings and discussions with the international community to stress the need to support the operational plan to address the “Safer” tanker situation, and to expand upon support the Kingdom has previously provided for maintenance of the vessel. The USD 10 million that the Kingdom is providing today will support the efforts of UN organizations to develop an effective plan to identify and address the potential threats posed by the “Safer” tanker. The Kingdom calls upon the United Nations to immediately take the necessary actions to prevent oil leakage from the tanker, and to either transfer the oil to a safe place or use it to benefit the Yemeni people. The Kingdom also calls on the international community to contribute urgently to support for this initiative in order to prevent a serious environmental disaster from occurring.",['Technological Disaster']
" Highlights Response operations continued throughout the weekend. Based on adjusted figures, the Office of National Security has reported that, as of 20 August 2017, the total number of registered people affected by the floods and landslides stands at 5,905 in over six communities Culvert, Dwarzark, Kamayamah, Kanikay, Kaninko and Regent . Through further assessments, it was determined that the earlier reported “crack” at the opposite side of the mountain range that fed the landslide in Regent is not a “crack” but it’s a flow of debris from the original landslide and thus is not presenting imminent risks. To support the United Nations response, a United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination Team has been deployed to Sierra Leone. The team will assist with coordination, information management and needs assessment activities. In the meantime, UNICEF is continuing to support the Government of Sierra Leone in ensuring the provision of WASH services, infection prevention and control materials, and essential medicines at the temporary displacement centres and in health facilities to prevent and mitigate the propagation of diseases, such as cholera. UNICEF also continued to support affected children, including provision of psychosocial support and identification of child protection concerns. As of 20 August, supplies with a total value of US 179,024 have been distributed to implementing partners to support affected communities.","['Flood', 'Mud Slide']"

" SITUATION • An estimated 4.5 million people were projected to face Crisis IPC 3 or worse levels of acute food insecurity from October through January, according to the August IPC analysis. Large scale humanitarian food assistance continues to mitigate more severe food insecurity outcomes in several areas of concern, according to FEWS NET. In September, more than two million South Sudanese were reached with food assistance however, this remains well below the estimated total population in need. • Heavy flooding has affected an estimated 908,000 people across Eastern Equatoria, Jonglei, and Upper Nile states, as well as parts of Lakes, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Unity, and Warrap states where households already faced Crisis or worse levels of acute food insecurity, according to OCHA. As a result, the number of severely food insecure is higher than originally projected, with Emergency IPC 4 outcomes in Ulang, Maiut, and Maban counties of Upper Nile, as well as in Duk county of Jonglei, according to FEWS NET. Previously anticipated food security gains will be largely negated in areas where floods are affecting crop production, market functioning, and delivery of food assistance. • Despite expectations that conflict events will continue to decline in South Sudan, high levels of acute food insecurity are likely to persist in 2020 with areas projected to experience food gaps indicative of Crisis or worse outcomes. Additionally, FEWS NET projects that in the event of a resurgence of conflict preventing people from moving in search of food sources or restricting humanitarian access for a prolonged period, some counties—already experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity—will be left at risk of Famine IPC 5 in 2020. • The prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition GAM has worsened from 13.3 percent in the 2018 lean season—the period when food is typically most scarce—to 16.2 percent in the 2019 lean season, according to the August IPC analysis. Food and non food factors, including poor access to health, nutrition, and WASH services, are contributing to the increased GAM rate. RESPONSE • Since the start of the conflict in South Sudan, USAID’s Office of Food for Peace FFP and its partners—including the UN World Food Program WFP and the UN Children’s Fund UNICEF —have assisted the most vulnerable and conflict affected populations through emergency food and nutrition interventions across the country. • FFP partners with Catholic Relief Services to provide emergency food assistance, access to safe drinking water, and livelihoods support in Jonglei State, as well as the UN Food and Agriculture Organization FAO to support households with food vouchers and distribution of seeds, planting tools, and fishing kits for increased food production.","['Drought', 'Flood', 'Other']"
" KABUL, 17 November 2022 – As world leaders knuckle down for the final days of climate negotiations at COP27, 70 of children in Afghanistan – one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the impacts of the climate crisis – are under threat from extreme weather events, as drought conditions are predicted to stretch into 2023, Save the Children said. The climate crisis poses a serious risk to all Afghan children whose families or communities survive on farming – nearly 13.2 million children i —, with current drought and unseasonal summer floods wiping out crops, killing livestock, drastically reducing vital food supplies and diminishing water sources. This year’s spring rains were the lowest they have been in five years and now the country’s reservoirs and other groundwater sources are drying up. With the coming wet season forecast to fail, the country’s unprecedented drought is now predicted to stretch into 2023. ii iii About 27.8 million people live in rural areas in Afghanistan, mostly on farms, and are likely to face increased threats from climate shocks due to their reliance on agriculture and livestock for survival. The current catastrophic combination of extreme drought, floods and the economic crisis mean many farming families are on the brink of starvation and are turning to drastic measures to put food on the table. Malnutrition cases in children under five have increased in Save the Children’s mobile clinics by almost 50 compared with January 2022 https reliefweb.int node 3901108 , with doctors struggling to keep up with the surge in demand for treatment. With winter approaching and food stores drastically below what they should be after the summer harvest season, Save the Children warned that the next few months would be critical for children, who are bearing the brunt of the hunger crisis. Access to clean water is also becoming more difficult by the day, with children walking for hours to collect water for their families or in some cases, drinking dirty water, exposing them to deadly water borne diseases such as acute watery diarrhoea. A recent countrywide assessment found 80 of households in rural areas and 75 of households in urban areas don’t have enough water for drinking, cooking and bathing. iv Child labour is also on the rise v , with desperate parents taking their children out of school and sending them to work on the streets, in other people’s homes, factories and mines to make up for the income they have lost due to the drought or floods. Fahim , 10, lives with his parents and his grandfather, Sohail in one of the hardest to reach areas in Balkh province in northern Afghanistan. The drought has devastated their lives, forcing them to sell off their assets just to buy food to survive. Fahim said “ The drought has negatively impacted on my life. I can't go to school very often because I spend time collecting clean drinking water. It takes me a lot of time and I don’t like it. In the past, water sources were close to our house but now they have dried up . “ The drought has reduced our family’s income and when we don't have money, we can't afford to buy the food we need. It’s had a negative impact on my brother’s health. He is malnourished because we can't feed him properly .” Sohail said “ Two years ago, there was rain, and we had enough water for irrigation, and we had a good life. In the last two years, there has been no rain and not enough water for irrigation and when we sow any crops in the fields, we cannot harvest anything . “ Given we haven’t been able to grow anything on our land, we have sold all our livestock and we don’t have any cows and calves left. We sold them to provide some money to meet the needs of the family. In the past, when we had enough good food, our children were healthy, but now they look like skeletons .” Save the Children’s Country Director in Afghanistan, Chris Nyamandi, said “Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of extreme weather events in Afghanistan, and families have no way of getting back on their feet before the next disaster hits. Add the current economic crisis to this situation, and families are hanging on by a thread. “With winter approaching, Save the Children is extremely concerned about families hit by the drought and floods and how they will survive the icy temperatures without their normal food stocks and without enough income to pay for heating and winter clothes for their children. “There is no doubt that climate change is making the crisis in Afghanistan far more extreme. Leaders currently meeting at the COP27 summit must commit to bringing tangible change to the daily lives of children in Afghanistan who are suffering right now from the impacts of the climate crisis. Not only do they need immediate humanitarian funding to help them survive the winter, they also need longer term funding to help them adapt and cope with the changing environment.” Save the Children is calling on world leaders at COP27 to ensure there is a focus on children’s rights and equity while making critical decisions that will affect children’s futures. The child rights organisation is also calling on governments to support the creation of a new loss and damage climate finance mechanism to help address the cost of the impacts of the climate crisis to children’s rights. This includes supporting communities already hit by climate impacts, such as children in Afghanistan.

"In the wake of severe flooding across Bangladesh, India, China and Nepal, Save the Children warns that years of development progress could be eroded if education isn’t prioritised during the emergency response. Intense flooding in South and East Asia has so far affected almost 40 million people since June, including approximately 10 million children, bursting riverbanks, washing away homes and destroying crucial infrastructure. The combined death toll between these four countries alone has risen beyond 700, including 480 in India, 160 in China, 50 in Nepal and 21 in Bangladesh. Almost 1,600 schools have been forced to close in Bangladesh, either due to storm damage or because they have been repurposed as emergency shelters for the displaced, leaving some 319,000 children missing out on vital education. At least 3.7 million people have also been impacted by the flooding across 19 districts, with over 16,000 houses completely washed away. “There’s a chance that some children who are unable to go to school for extended periods might never go back, particularly if the impact of the disaster on their family’s assets results in pressure on them to earn money for the household,” said Michael McGrath, Save the Children’s Acting Asia Regional Director. “Children’s schooling needs to be prioritised across the region in the aftermath of the flooding, and Save the Children is ready to support the provincial, regional and national education authorities to ensure that schools reopen as soon as possible. “This will include setting up temporary classrooms while damaged school buildings are being repaired or schools are being evacuated, replacing damaged educational materials, getting children back in the classroom and supporting students’ psychosocial needs are also among our key priorities.” Save the Children is currently responding to floods in India, Bangladesh, China and Nepal. The humanitarian agency has already distributed thousands of relief items to affected families including tarpaulins, hygiene kits, sanitation items and floor mats, as well as setting up safe spaces for children to play and recover. In China, almost 30 million people have been affected by the floods, and tens of thousands of houses have collapsed – a situation only compounded when Typhoon Nepartak made landfall on July 10, bringing powerful winds and more torrential rains. In India, more than 5.4 million people have been affected across the country, with Save the Children responding in three of the worst affected states of Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. “Nowadays, floods are seen as a chronic problem and are viewed quite differently from other emergencies – so they often no longer attract adequate attention from either the media or donors,” said Thomas Chandy, CEO of Save the Children India. “Therefore it is critical that we develop better, more effective, long term resilience solutions to help families to prepare for floods and cope better with the consequences.” “Save the Children stands ready to respond to the humanitarian needs following Tropical Storm Dianmu if required rainfall has been relentless in many parts of the region in recent weeks and, with Dianmu now on its way, we must continue preparing for further flood damage,” McGrath added. Save the Children has a long history responding to humanitarian crises in the region, including flooding in Uttarakhand in 2013, Kashmir in 2014 and south India in 2015 as well as following cyclones Phailin in 2013 and Hudhud in 2014. Save the Children is also still responding to last year’s earthquake in Nepal.","['Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Severe Local Storm', 'Tropical Cyclone']"

" Situation Update Typhoon Haiyan, one of the worst storms in Southeast Asia slammed across the Visaya Region of Central Philippines on the morning of 8 November 2013. With deathtoll stands around 6,294, more than 16 million people from 44 provinces were affected, nearly 4.1 million people are displaced. Over 1.1 million houses are either damaged and half of them completely destroyed. Six months have passed since the typhoon left devastating marks. Humanitarian needs for the affected population have now moved on from emergency relief to longer term recovery, these including rebuilding their houses, reviving livelihood means, and to regain access to basic infrastructure and social services like healthcare and schools . Six months on, people have shown remarkable strength. However, high level of pre existing poverty has hold them back from in areas especially when basic services recovery are underway. The needs of external support on livelihoods, improved health, better shelter and future resilience of the affected communities are still eminent. Hong Kong Red Cross Actions Right after the typhoon hit the country, on 12 November 2013, the Hong Kong Red Cross HKRC launched an emergency appeal to the Hong Kong public. A total of 81 corporations, organizations and schools have organized fundraising activities to support the affected population in the Philippines. As of end of March 2014, an approximate HK 31 million has been received from Hong Kong public to support the Typhoon Haiyan operation. Since the first month of the disaster, the HKRC has supported immediate deployment of personnel and delivery of relief and early recovery materials to the most affected area see below for details . Subsequent planning has been made to look into early to longer term recovery needs of the affected population. So far, 95,000 people is benefitted through immediate relief while at least another 185,000 people are aimed at for longer term recovery programs. Summary of achievements by HKRC actions so far Completed tasks Distributed 3,250 family hygiene kits and 13,500 blankets and sleeping mats Distributed food packs to 17,300 families Deployed 9 medical volunteers for medical and basic healthcare services to the affected people in Leyte, Cebu and Samar between November 2013 to February 2014 Deployed 1 Restoring Family Link RFL specialist to Leyte to process over 300 missing persons cases Offered emergency tracing and or psycholgical support services to approximately 400 persons in Hong Kong Procured and delivered school equipment including blackboards, chairs and desks to 20 temporary schools in Tacloban. On going Programmes Rehabilitating health facilities, including hospitals, health stations and units for a population of 180,000 in Samar Supporting 5 rural communities in Capitz in rebuilding shelter, livelihoods, sanitation, health and education facilities Integrating disaster risk reduction to all recovery programmes. Other Red Cross Actions Global appeal has been revised since it first launched. At the moment, Red Cross globally is seeking a total of CHF 163.86 million approximately HKD 1.4 billion to support 150,000 families approximately 750,000 people with food, clean water, safe shelter, health, livelihoods and disaster risk reduction over a period of 3 years. As of today, the following have been achieved by Red Cross Over 1 million people have received emergency relief items including food, household items, hygiene kits and emergency shelter materials from Red Cross 17,604,000 litres of clean water distributed daily to affected communities, 65 water networks servicing 9 municipalities have been fully repaired 138,435 households received emergency shelter support, this covered 25 per cent of total emergency shelter needs across the affected region 100,413 families reached through the Red Cross hygiene promotion activities, reducing the spread of communicable diseases 20,043 patients assisted by the emergency health facilities established 23,553 people re established contact with their family through satellite phones and other means provided by the Red Cross, including by registering as I'm alive on the International Red Cross website 31,539 people benefitting from psychosocial support 8,235 total number of Philippine Red Cross volunteers deployed 161 school classrooms constructed.

"23 September 2021 JUBA GENEVA – By diverting staggering amounts of money and other wealth from South Sudan’s public coffers and resources, South Sudan’s leaders are undermining human rights and endangering security, the Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan has found in its latest Conference Room Paper https reliefweb.int node 3776627 presented to the Human Rights Council in Geneva today. According to investigations carried out by the Commission over the past two years, more than 73 million USD was diverted since 2018, including transactions worth almost 39 million USD in a period of less than two months. The Commission noted that this figure is only a fraction of the overall amount looted as President Salva Kiir himself admitted as far back as 2012, South Sudan’s ruling elites had diverted more than 4 billion USD. The Commission is mandated to monitor and report on the human rights situation in South Sudan, and to clarify responsibility for alleged violations and related crimes, as well as to make recommendations to improve the situation. In its Conference Room Paper, the Commission has highlighted how the systematic, illicit diversion of State resources has severely undermined the economic, social and cultural rights of citizens. This plundering also continues to fuel political competition amongst elites, and is a key driver of the on going conflict, violations and serious crimes, jeopardising the prospects for sustainable peace. The Commission’s recommendations aimed at the Government of South Sudan seek to ensure that the State is able to protect and fulfil the rights of its citizens. The Commission’s Conference Room Paper also highlights that South Sudan’s elites have deliberately adopted a highly informal system of oil revenue collection, in which the absence of independent oversight and transparency facilitates and enables the misappropriation of public funds. Similarly flawed, non transparent processes for contract payments, procurements, and revenue are operated illicitly to divert non oil revenues. In just one emblematic case, the Commission revealed how a single payment made unlawfully in May 2018 by the Ministry of Finance to Sudanese businessman Ashraf Seed Ahmed Al Cardinal, also known as “Al Cardinal”, represented a staggering 21.6 per cent of South Sudan’s total budget for the “Use of Goods and Services” and “Capital Expenditure” for the entire 2018 2019 fiscal year. “The Commission’s documentation of the corruption, embezzlement, bribery, and misappropriation of State funds by political elites is merely the tip of the iceberg”, stated Commission Chair Yasmin Sooka. “Our investigations traced exactly how this money is being diverted, and our findings revealing the patterns and trends of the embezzlement include the involvement of politicians, Government officials, international corporations, military personnel, and multinational banks in these crimes. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, the National Revenue Authority, and a number of foreign corporations have all been complicit in this”, she added. The Commission’s Conference Room Paperalso emphasises and draws a link between the illicit diversion of funds and the inadequacy of resources available to public authorities to fulfil their legal obligations to provide for the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights of citizens. “The violations of human rights and related crimes we have been investigating refer to a broad category of activities involving money, finances, or assets, the purpose of which is to unlawfully obtain a profit or advantage for the perpetrators”, explained Commissioner Andrew Clapham. “These activities are proscribed by both national legislation and international law, including the Transitional Constitution of South Sudan, the Anti Corruption Commission Act, and the Investigation Committees Act. As a State party, South Sudan is further bound by the UN Convention against Corruption. Accordingly, other States party to that Convention may be obligated to repatriate funds that originated in South Sudan and were illicitly used to purchase real estate abroad, as we have documented in considerable detail”, he added. The Commission’s report also highlights that South Sudan’s oil industry is dominated by unaccountable oil consortia, the actions of which have wrought considerable devastation, including environmental degradation and damage impacting on the health of citizens. Oil spills in the Pariang and Rubkona counties of Unity State, for example, have led to pre term births, stillbirths, congenital anomalies or deaths in new borns, blindness, male sexual dysfunction, and low fertility. “We have analysed a series of preventable health incidents induced by disease and devastating birth defects, including many that can be directly attributed to the presence of crude oil contamination in water, contributing to environmental degradation”, stated Commission Chair Yasmin Sooka. “The harm wreaked by these major oil consortia on local communities, and in particular the impact on infants who continue to suffer from severe birth defects, is utterly egregious and devastating for families”, she added. The Commission also underscored that the illicit gains from economic crimes also serve as a major driver of armed conflict in South Sudan. “South Sudan’s damaging conflicts have been significantly enabled and even motivated by the opportunities to control and divert natural resources as well as oil and non oil revenues”, said Commissioner Barney Afako. “Moreover, national authorities and elites have prioritised the financing of military and security apparatuses over investment in public services, infrastructure, and livelihoods. We strongly urge the Government to act swiftly and decisively fully to implement Chapter IV of the Revitalised Peace Agreement, which provides the appropriate basis for ensuring the effective resource, economic, and financial management in South Sudan”, he added. The Commission has identified several individuals allegedly linked to human rights violations and related economic crimes, and has included them in its confidential list that will be handed to the High Commissioner for Human Rights for the purpose of facilitating transitional justice responses, including investigations and prosecutions. ENDS The Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan was established by the Human Rights Council in March 2016 and extended in March 2017, and for further years in March 2018, March 2019, June 2020, and March 2021 with a mandate to determine and report the facts and circumstances of, collect and preserve evidence of, and clarify responsibility for alleged gross violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes, including sexual and gender based violence and ethnic violence, with a view to ending impunity and providing accountability.

" Highlights • Over 4.89 million children required humanitarian assistance in the year 2019. Displacements due to inter ethnic conflicts, food insecurity triggered by natural and man made crises, and disease outbreaks drove humanitarian needs. • UNICEF supported over 1.41 million children with WASH Non Food Items NFIs 731,044 children were vaccinated against measles of which 11,044 were newly arrived refugee children 315,467 children were treated for Severe Acute Malnutrition SAM , including 4,017 refugee children 263,894 children including 134,586 girls were given access to education 99,681 children were provided with psychosocial support and 117,164 women and children received information on Gender Based Violence GBV how it can be prevented and how survivors can access support and services. • UNICEF’s programme implementation was affected by restricted access to communities due to insecurity, underfunding to deliver the planned services, interruption to service delivery due to a return campaign led by the Government, and limited partner presence in critical geographical areas. Situation in Numbers 4.89 million of children in need of humanitarian assistance 8.86 million people in need HRP October 20192 1.6 million Internally displaced people IDPs – DTM Round 193 735,204 registered refugees UNHCR December 2019 Situation Overview Humanitarian Needs In 2019, conflict induced displacement, climatic shocks, and the lack of recovery from previous years have continued to drive humanitarian needs. Ethiopia is home to 735,204 refugees, of whom 415,3901 are children. New monthly arrivals in 2019 varied from 6,000 to 11,000, with more than three quarters of arrivals from Eritrea. In April, the number of internally displaced persons, driven by conflict and drought, peaked at 3.1 million 2.5 million were conflict induced and 600,000 were climate induced 61 per cent were children . Internally displaced people, especially those living in collective sites, had limited access to basic services, lacked opportunities to rebuild livelihoods, and faced protection risks amid wider security concerns. Family separations, breakdown of support networks, disease outbreaks, and interrupted access to food in 2019, worsened existing vulnerabilities to acute malnutrition. Poor or no access to primary health services, inadequate water and sanitation facilities, and poor health seeking and hygiene practices put displaced children at a higher risk of contracting preventable diseases in crowded collective sites. Following the March launch of the Government’s Plan to address internal displacements in Ethiopia, over 2.1 million conflict induced IDPs had been returned, integrated or relocated by May2. Nevertheless, 1.6 million IDPs3, including 850,000 children, are still officially displaced and will require humanitarian assistance in 2020. Likewise, many of those returned remained displaced, without access to basic services and recovery support, and in communities experiencing on going or renewed insecurity. New displacements are active and remain a threat to existing caseloads as the potential for conflicts over scarce natural resources and unresolved regional border issues remain. Erratic and below normal spring belg gu genna rainfall resulted in water and pasture shortages and poor livestock conditions and contributed to deteriorating food and nutrition security in the lowlands. Food insecurity affected over eight million people. In 2020, food security is expected to worsen to Crisis IPC 34 between February and June in Belg dependent and pastoralist areas affecting 4.2 million children, of whom 444,000 are expected to be affected by SAM, and three million pregnant and lactating women and children are expected to be affected by Moderate Acute Malnutrition MAM . Floods in Afar, Amhara, Benishangul Gumuz, Gambella, Oromia, Southern Nations Nationalities and People’s Region SNNP , Somali and Tigray contributed to displacements and the loss of livestock and crops affecting 795,000 people. In the Somali Region, unseasonal and extended heavy rainfall resulted in floods that severely damaged infrastructure and disrupted people’s livelihoods. Ethiopia remains vulnerable to outbreaks of epidemic prone diseases. Cholera is a major public health risk and 2,565 cases were reported in 2019 in Addis Ababa, Afar, Amhara, Dire Dawa, Harari, Oromia, SNNP, Somali and Tigray regions. While reported cases were lower than in previous years, predisposing factors remain, with communities remaining vulnerable. Other epidemics reported in 2019 include measles, vaccine derived polio virus type 2, malaria and chikungunya. With Ethiopia endorsing the amended Refugee Proclamation in January 20195, it is imperative that interventions are designed to not only respond to immediate humanitarian needs but establish, longer term durable solutions for refugee integration within host communities. Similarly, Ethiopia’s commitment to ratification of the Kampala Convention and consequent national legislation would ensure better protection of IDP rights in Ethiopian domestic law and policy. A Durable Solutions Initiative for IDPs was launched in December 2019 and intends to link humanitarian and development interventions for longer term sustainable gains. Similarly, a Multi Year Resilience Strategy will be implemented from 2020 2025 to improve outcomes for 12 drought prone zones in Ethiopia’s north east that have received multi year assistance for both chronic poverty and food insecurity.","['Drought', 'Epidemic', 'Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Insect Infestation']"
"The KwaZulu Natal Provincial Government has unveiled a multimillion rand project, which will lead to the upgrade and rehabilitation of strategic roads damaged by the recent floods. Launched in Mbumbulu on Monday, the R500 million road project is part of the provincial government’s continued effort to rebuild transport infrastructure that was damaged by the floods. KwaZulu Natal Premier, Sihle Zikalala, led the launch of the infrastructure turnaround plan which includes the upgrading of section P725 from blacktop to tar and the rehabilitating of another section of the road that had been severely damaged. More than R409 million has been allocated for the upgrading with R86.5 million allocated to rehabilitate the stretch of the road from eNgonyameni and uMlazi section. The road is vital in connecting many wards between uMbumbulu, eFolweni, eNgonyameni and uMlazi. It also provides a link to the R603, which is strategic for the movement of goods. Zikalala said the launch is part of provincial government’s commitment to restore the provincial economy and ensure connectivity in many communities. He noted that areas surrounding eThekwini Metro were the hardest hit by the recent torrential rains. The province, through the provincial Transport Department, has to reprioritise budget allocation for this financial year to attend to urgent emergency repairs. “Working with the South African Road Agency SANRAL , the department is also attending to projects such as the N2, R102 and M4. The province is moving with speed in restoring damaged infrastructure and will continue to prioritise those communities that were most affected,” Zikalala said. The construction and rehabilitation of a section of a road is a living testimony that “as the provincial government we are serious about fulfilling the commitment of recovery and reconstruction”. “This investment will ensure that the people of eThekwini are able to connect and link with important facilities. This will also create jobs and much needed economic growth for the area. “Importantly, it will open economic activities which will benefit the emerging small entrepreneurs which were affected by the recent floods,” Zikalala said. Zikalala made a commitment that the provincial government will be unveiling a number of projects in the next few weeks and handing over contractors that will be doing repairs. He said the province has more than 1 365 projects that were affected by floods and needs in excess of R6.5 billion to fix them. – SAnews.gov.za .","['Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Mud Slide']"
" Key messages Resilience and Sustainability To address the long term needs of the population in need, World Vision’s programs build the capacity and skills of people to support themselves. Training on livelihoods, vocational and business skills, proper nutrition, health and sanitation among others are being conducted to encourage resilience and sustainability. This month, over 890 farmers in Northern Bahr El Gazal learned about improved farming techniques and were provided with seeds and farm tools. This ongoing livelihood capacity building is being implemented across World Vision’s operational areas. Food Insecurity December 2018 marked five years since the outbreak of the current conflict in South Sudan, which has resulted in an estimated 380,000 excess deaths, 4.4 million people displaced, substantial macroeconomic decline, and widespread acute food insecurity. World Vision’s food assistance has reached close to 300,000 people through various programming initiatives across the four zones in the country. Preparedness Following the outbreak of the Ebola Virus Disease EVD in the North Kivu Province of the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo at the beginning of August 2018, there is an increased threat of cross border spread into South Sudan. To prevent the potential spread and ensure readiness for any eventualities, a preparedness and response plan has been activated in the Western Equatoria zone led by World Vision and in partnership with the Ministry of Health, World Health Organisation and other partner agencies.","['Drought', 'Epidemic', 'Other']"
" The Cox’s Bazar Gender in Humanitarian Action Working Group GiHA WG is deeply concerned about the safety and well being of the Rohingya refugees affected by the massive fire outbreak on the afternoon of March 22, 2021. The fire outbreak affected Camps 8W, 9, 10 and 8E located in Balukhali and Kutupalong areas that accommodate Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh. This Gender Alert has been developed by GiHA WG as an aide memoire of the gender specific impacts of the fire. It focuses on the promotion of a Gender Responsive Humanitarian Response that places the needs and dignity of women, girls, men, and boys at the centre. It concludes with a set of recommendations for all stakeholders involved in the fire response. This Gender Alert serves to advance the gender equality commitments and gender responsive measures by providing a basis for an informed analysis on the genderspecific impacts of the fire. By assessing, coordinating, and responding to the trends identified and discussed throughout, the document serves as a guide for stakeholders to integrate gender equality commitments across the fire response and to address the specific needs of vulnerable Rohingya refugees living in the affected areas while maintaining COVID 19 prevention measures. Context On the afternoon of March 22, 2021, a massive fire broke out in the Rohingya refugee camps in Ukhiya, Cox’s Bazar. The fire quickly spread across three camps consuming shelters and personal belongings of refugees as well as essential facilities such as hospitals, primary health facilities, learning centers, and women friendly spaces in the camps. More than 48,000 individuals have been affected by the fire. Many are staying with relatives or in learning and transit centers which are accommodating the most vulnerable people. The Government of Bangladesh and aid agencies are responding to those affected. The distribution of water, hot meals and high energy biscuits is ongoing. Emergency shelter and non food relief item kits including floor mats, blankets, solar lamps, have been provided to those affected. The priority is to reunite families and children who were separated during the fire and the subsequent movements to safe places, as well as to identify and support persons with specific needs, such as older persons, pregnant women and persons with disabilities. This fire outbreak has highlighted the capacity of women and men volunteers as first responders. They are helping people to safety, supporting fire response efforts and continue to work to support aid efforts on the ground. Conflict and humanitarian crises affect women, girls, men, and boys differently. This fire outbreak is no exception. Systematic efforts to collect sex, age and disability disaggregated data SADDD and to consult with the affected population must be put in place to ensure that the diverse needs of all groups are fully understood and targeted effectively in the response.",['Technological Disaster']
" OVERVIEW Colombia experiences very high climate exposure concentrated in small portions of the country and high fragility stemming largely from persistent insecurity related to both longstanding and new sources of violence. Colombia’s effective political institutions, welldeveloped social service delivery systems and strong regulatory foundation for economic policy position the state to continue making important progress. Yet, at present, high climate risks in pockets across the country and government mismanagement of those risks have converged to increase Colombians’ vulnerability to humanitarian emergencies. Despite the state’s commitment to address climate risks, the country’s historically high level of violence has strained state capacity to manage those risks, while also contributing directly to people’s vulnerability to climate risks where people displaced by conflict have resettled in high exposure areas. This is seen in high exposure rural areas like Mocoa where the population’s vulnerability to local flooding risks is increased by the influx of displaced Colombians, lack of government regulation to prevent settlement in flood prone areas and deforestation that has removed natural barriers to flash flooding and mudslides. This is also seen in high exposure urban areas like Barranquilla, where substantial risks from storm surge and riverine flooding are made worse by limited government planning and responses to address these risks, resulting in extensive economic losses and infrastructure damage each year due to fairly predictable climate risks. This brief summarizes findings from a broader USAID case study of fragility and climate risks in Colombia Moran et al. 2018b and a USAID report on The Intersection of Global Fragility and Climate Risks Moran et al. 2018a . Key findings from the global report are summarized in the box on the next page. KEY FINDINGS Fragility Risks Colombia experiences high overall fragility compared to other countries globally, and in recent years it has faced the greatest fragility of all countries in South America, though that ranking may change as the peace process continues in Colombia and stability deteriorates in Venezuela. Colombia’s fragility stems primarily from poor state effectiveness, particularly in the security and economic spheres. However, Colombia does benefit from strong political and social institutions. Colombia has also made key gains to the rule of law, private property rights and channels for entering the formal economy that have brought Colombia to the best rating globally for economic legitimacy. Climate Risks Colombia has nearly 2 million people living in high exposure areas. These include 1 low lying coastal zones, particularly around Barranquilla and Cartagena, at risk of storm surges, flash floods and chronic aridity 2 coastal and inland areas of Chocó, Antioquia and Córdoba departments that face decreased rainfall, riverine flooding and coastal flooding and 3 pockets of high exposure in Putumayo department in the south that faces flooding and decreased rainfall. Compound Fragility Climate Risks Colombians’ vulnerability in high exposure places like rural Mocoa—where conflict displacement, unchecked deforestation and unregulated settlement exacerbate flood risks—and coastal Barranquilla—where government response has not mitigated routine flooding—highlight what can happen when climate risks converge with mismanagement of those risks by a government affected by fragility. However, Colombia can draw on its political institutional capacity to adopt—and its social service capacity to implement—policies to reduce the future impact of climate hazards, but this requires addressing aspects of both its fragility and climate challenges.","['Flood', 'Tropical Cyclone', 'Wild Fire']"
"Heavy rain hit Mandalay yesterday, inundating low lying areas, causing trees to fall and creating havoc on roads. The four hour rainfall started around 10 pm Saturday and tied the record for most rainfall in August with 6.2 inches. The flooding began to recede yesterday afternoon. Isolated heavy rainfall is expected to pour down over Kayin State, Mon State, Nay Pyi Taw, Mandalay Region, Bago Region, Ayeyawady Region, Taninthayi Region and Rakhine State today, according to the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology. Local people in Mandalay place the blame on land work projects for the flooding this year. The land work has changed the waterway, causing it to overflow from the creeks and the Ayeyawady River. “The situation of this year’s flood, which submerged some areas with unusual strength, is considered to be because of man made works, and La Nina has also made the situation worsen,’ said Chief Minister of Mandalay Region Dr Zaw Myint Maung.

"Thursday 22 December 2011 2011 has been the busiest year for Save the Children’s Humanitarian Emergencies team in our 90 year history 45 emergency responses, in 38 different countries. We’re really very tired. But the first few days of an emergency are critical. It’s simple. It’s life and death. The faster we respond, the more lives we save. This year we flew aid planes into conflict zones, faced a nuclear threat in Japan, and launched responses in the aftermath of countless floods, droughts and earthquakes. On the frontline We are still working quietly but steadily under the radar but on the front line, in war torn countries around the world. We’ve reached 3.3 million children in emergencies so far, and we’re still counting. We used rickety boats to deliver life saving aid to families in Sri Lanka, where the worst rains in nearly 100 years had forced people from their homes. We were able to respond immediately – distributing food packs and essential supplies to over 4,000 people. Only days later Brazil suffered extremely heavy rains, which caused terrifying mudslides – claiming the lives of around 500 people and leaving homes and schools inaccessible. We supported over 9,000 children and helped them to recover. Libya Fierce fighting in Libya then placed thousands of children in danger, and left families without fuel, water or electricity. A small rapid emergency response team entered Libya at extreme personal risk and distributed essential supplies to families, and helped terrified children, unable to escape the scenes of violence and death. Maps of Libya plastered the walls of the office, and we kept a close eye on the rapidly shifting battle lines. Japan In March a major earthquake hit the east coast of Japan, followed by a massive tsunami and multiple aftershocks – resulting in a death toll of over 15,000. The destruction left hundreds of thousands of children and their families without shelter – and children separated from families in the panic and chaos. We launched into action immediately – with an appeal that helped us reach nearly 5,000 children. Ivory Coast Large swathes of Ivory Coast then descended into violence and hundreds of thousands of children found themselves in grave danger – thousands were trapped in their homes, too scared to leave. We urgently flew in aid to help thousands of children and adults – distributing food, soap, sleeping mats and blankets. Our staff worked tirelessly throughout the conflict, helping to reunify families and support yet more children. East Africa Millions of children faced starvation after a devastating drought in East Africa. Save the Children was already on the ground, saving lives. The world’s media started reporting in June – we had been responding months before it hit the headlines. The number of people at risk increased dramatically – from 7 million people in June, to over 13 million people now. It was our biggest ever emergency appeal and response in our 90 year history. Without the ready to go funds from our Emergency Fund we would be forced to wait for the world’s media to report crises, to wait for often sluggish donors to respond. But we don’t have to wait to save lives in an emergency. We are already there.","['Drought', 'Earthquake', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Other', 'Severe Local Storm', 'Tsunami']"

"21 January 2013 Afghanistan Children among 17 dead in camps amid harsh winter conditions At least 17 people, including 11 children, have died mostly from the cold in Afghanistan’s displacement settlements in early January, highlighting the desperate and immediate need for improved aid delivery during the bitter cold winter months, Amnesty International said. According to information Amnesty International has received, the deaths occurred in camps and settlements in Kabul and Herat provinces. Community leaders there criticized the Afghan government and international aid agencies for inconsistent and inadequate levels of assistance. “These deaths were a preventable tragedy that unfortunately shows the inadequate co ordination of winter assistance to hundreds of thousands of people living in displacement camps across the country,” said Polly Truscott, Amnesty International’s Deputy Asia Pacific Director. “The fact that children and the elderly are among the dead highlights the need to protect those groups that are most vulnerable to the harsh winter conditions. Priority must be given to those most at risk during the winter months, such as children, the elderly, people with disabilities and those needing medical care, including pregnant women.” The previous 2011 12 winter was unusually cold in Afghanistan, and more than 100 people, mostly children, died in displacement camps as a result of the harsh winter conditions. Amnesty International and other NGOs have repeatedly made calls to the Afghan government and the international community to avoid a repeat of last year’s tragic deaths, including in an open letter on 19 October 2012, signed by 30 NGOs. Amnesty International spoke to representatives for internally displaced persons IDPs in a settlement in Balkh district in northern Balkh province, from the Maslakh IDP settlement in western Herat province and from several settlements in Kabul. The camps together house thousands of IDPs. IDP representatives from Balkh province reported that they had not received any kind of aid supplies despite repeated requests to the government and international agencies. They spoke of extremely harsh cold weather conditions, with heavy snowfall and a lack of both protection from the elements and enough food to eat. The deaths all occurred in the first two weeks of January – four in Herat and 13 in Kabul. In Herat, assistance reached refugees returning to Afghanistan from abroad, but aid to those internally displaced was apparently blocked after pressure from the Herat provincial governor’s office. The local authorities there are said to be concerned that offering aid to IDPs will encourage them to stay in camps permanently instead of returning to their home provinces. “These deaths show the urgent need to protect all IDPs, to improve coordination and assistance, and to identify areas where IDPs find themselves without assistance. Aid has been unevenly distributed across the country, meaning that those displaced in outlying provinces like Balkh and some Herat IDPs are suffering disproportionately,” said Truscott. IDP community leaders also said that no food supplies were included in the winter assistance packs, while fuel supplies provided were not enough to last the winter. With few jobs or other sources of income available, displaced families often lack the resources to buy sufficient food and fuel. Decades of conflict have left Afghanistan with one of the highest internally displaced populations in the world, estimated to be 450,000, according to UNHCR but the actual number is likely to be much higher. The Afghan government is working on a much needed comprehensive policy for IDPs that should recognize their protection and humanitarian needs, but efforts to assist and protect IDPs cannot wait – particularly over the winter. “There is a desperate need to act now to prevent further deaths this winter. This should include effective coordination between the government and agencies, and the timely provision of emergency winter supplies – like blankets, warm clothes, tarpaulins, clothing, stoves, water, fuel and food,” said Truscott. “Afghanistan and its donor partners should remember that safeguarding lives in these settlements is an obligation under international law.”.",['Cold Wave']

" Moscow shrouded in choking smoke, pollution levels soar p Forest fires rage across area bigger than Greater London p Kremlin chief returns to Moscow for meeting on fires p PM Putin visits firefighters in burning region p By Gleb Bryanski p VORONEZH, Russia, Aug 4 Reuters President Dmitry Medvedev broke off his summer holiday on Wednesday and flew back to Moscow for emergency talks as the death toll from Russia's deadliest wildfires in nearly four decades hit 48. p Thick clouds of acrid, choking smoke from forest and peat bog fires blanketed the capital. Authorities told residents to stay indoors despite the sweltering heat to avoid concentrations of toxic carbon monoxide well above safe levels. p Keen to stamp his authority on the government's response to the fires so far largely handled by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin Medvedev sacked several senior navy officers for failing to stop forest fires from ravaging a naval storage base outside Moscow last week and destroying valuable equipment. p quot Despite the fact that we asked the Defence Ministry to help with extinguishing fires to help the civil population, in the majority of cases the ministry cannot even protect itself, quot Medvedev told officials in the Kremlin after returning from his Black Sea summer residence at Sochi. p The fires have swept through Russia's tinder dry forests in the hottest summer since records began 130 years ago, leaving thousands homeless and prompting leaders to declare a state of emergency in seven of the worst hit regions. p Critics say the government has been slow to respond. They also allege that changes to the law rammed through parliament by the Kremlin and the timber lobby in 2006 fatally weakened fire protection in Russia's vast woodlands, the world's biggest. p quot The situation with forest fires in the country has on the whole stabilised but remains tense and dangerous, quot Prime Minister Vladimir Putin told officials during a visit to the southern region of Voronezh, one of the worst hit. p MONEY PLEDGE SOOTHES p Putin has promised the state will help rebuild all homes destroyed by the fires and has pledged generous compensation. p The prospect of government cash led a group of women to praise Russia's paramount leader when he visited a local hotel housing 155 people whose homes have burned down. p Residents thanked Putin for offering money and asked eagerly for details of compensation schemes, taking pictures of the premier on mobile phones as he spoke with them. p The visit to Voronezh contrasted sharply with a meeting in Nizhny Novgorod last Friday when villagers berated Putin, demanding immediate action to rebuild their homes. p Some 170,000 people including troops were battling at least 520 fires raging on Wednesday over an area of 1,885 sq km, the Emergencies Ministry said. p The wildfires are Russia's deadliest since 1972, when at least 104 people died in Moscow region alone in forest and peat fires that destroyed an area of 100,000 square km of the then Soviet Union, the ministry said. p A record heatwave has engulfed central parts of European Russia since mid June, ruining much of the wheat crop in some areas and raising fears that a poor harvest in the world's third largest wheat exporter could push up global food prices. p The economy showed the first signs of damage from the heatwave, with the services sector expanding in July at its slowest pace in four months. p German carmaker Volkswagen lt VOWG p.DE gt said that due to smoke from the fires, it had temporarily halted production at a factory in Kaluga, southwest of Moscow, that produced 48,500 cars last year. p MOSCOW SMOKE p Moscow, a city of 10.5 million, was shrouded in acrid smoke. p quot The pollution is at the worst level since 2002 and is approaching those levels, quot Alexei Popikov, an expert on air quality at Moscow's pollution monitoring agency, told Reuters. p The carbon monoxide count in Moscow soared to 5.7 times safe levels overnight and Russia's top lung doctor warned residents are inhaling the equivalent of 40 cigarettes every few hours. p City dwellers complained of waking with headaches and sore throats. Shops have run out of fans and some residents have taken to wearing masks over their mouths in the street. p The forest fires and scorching temperatures have complicated operations for Russia's large and ageing nuclear sector. p A reactor at the Novovoronezh power station was shut down on Wednesday because transformers broke due to high air temperatures. Other reactors at the station were working normally, state nuclear corporation Rosatom said. p More than 2,100 firefighters were battling fires near a secretive nuclear research centre at Sarov in Nizhny Novgorod province,where the first Soviet atom and hydrogen bombs were designed, about 350 km 220 miles east of Moscow.

The exercise will test the Tsunami and Other Coastal Hazards Warning System for the Caribbean and Adjacent Regions established in 2005 under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO IOC UNESCO . The exercise will test three scenarios simulating separate earthquakes one off the coast of Costa Rica, another off the coast of Cuba and a third northeast of the Lesser Antilles. It will feature fictitious messages sent by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre PTWC to the 48 countries taking part in the exercise. Known as Caribe Wave 17, the exercise will test the effectiveness of early warning provisions involving those responsible for the management of emergencies in the region, including national Tsunami Warning Focal Points, weather forecast centres, national coast guards, and emergency relief services. Interested countries will also be able to conducts tests at the local level. Over the last 500 years, 75 ocean tsunamis have occurred in the Caribbean, nearly 10 of the worldwide total over the same period. Tsunamis caused by earthquakes, landslides or volcanic activity have claimed more than 3,500 lives in the region since the middle of the 19th century according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA . The region has become ever more vulnerable to such risks due to massive population growth and the development of tourism in coastal areas.

" LOPEVI VOLCANO 16°30’23”S 169°20’18”E Summit 4635ft 1413m Current Vanuatu Volcano Alert Level Level 2 Lopevi volcano is continuing in the major unrest state. The Volcanic Alert Level remains at Level 2 . Lopevi volcano activity is continuing to be unstable in the level of major unrest. With the current state, the volcanic activity is likely to increase at any time but it could also remain at the same level for a longtime. Volcanic hazards remain on the island of Lopevi due to the current ongoing volcanic activity. The danger zone for life safety is limited to on the island of Lopevi . Latest observations and daily analysis of the Lopevi seismic data from the volcano monitoring system confirm that Lopevi volcanic activity conditions remains unstable and its activity is currently continuing in the high level of unrest. The activity continues to occur in the active craters near the summit crater. The volcano activity consists of continuous emission of steam plume. In the past, small or short lived eruptions have followed volcanic unrest at Lopevi. The chance for an eruptive phase to follow the current volcanic unrest, like in January 2017, is likely. The Lopevi Volcanic Alert Level VAL has been at Level 2 since 23 September 2017. The current observations are consistent with the activity of the Volcanic Alert Level 2. Level 2 indicates ‘ Major level of unrest Danger zone is on the island of Lopevi ’. With this current volcanic activity, it is a useful reminder that eruptions can occur with little or no warning . Lopevi is one of several frequently active volcanoes in Vanuatu. Ash producing eruptions can occur every 3 10 years. The volcano has been active during historical time at both summit and flank vents, producing moderate explosive eruptions and lava flows that reached the coast. Historical eruptions date back to the mid 19th century. The island was evacuated following major eruptions in 1939 and 1960. Only a family tries to live on the island these days. This is a reminder that all visitors to Lopevi may be affected by the volcanic unrest. It’s very important that authorities, communities, villages from the islands of Paama and Epi take this information into consideration . The Vanuatu Meteorology and Geohazards Department will continue to closely monitor this volcanic activity. More information will be provided when necessary.

" Summary The Security Council, in its resolution 2514 2020 https undocs.org en S RES 2514 2020 , requested the Secretary General to conduct an independent strategic review of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan UNMISS to assess the challenges to peace and security in the country and provide detailed recommendations for the possible reconfiguration of the Mission’s civilian, police and military components to account for developments in the peace process. In response to that request, the Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and the Department of Peace Operations assembled a team to carry out the review. The team conducted extensive consultations with a wide range of stakeholders, holding over 150 remote meetings with the senior leadership and staff of the Mission, the United Nations country team, United Nations offices in the region and all relevant United Nations entities based at United Nations Headquarters. It also held remote meetings with the African Union Commission and a number of its specialized institutions, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development IGAD , Member States and mechanisms involved in the peace process representatives of Security Council members and other members of the diplomatic community in both Juba and New York as well as think tanks and civil society organizations working on South Sudan. Challenges to peace and security in South Sudan The Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan Revitalized Peace Agreement outlines a clear vision for reforms that, if fully implemented, would help to address the underlying drivers of conflict and begin the transformation of the country. However, implementation has been slow and uneven. The timelines stipulated in the Revitalized Peace Agreement were, in some cases, unrealistic. Nevertheless, the parties have failed to meet any of those timelines and have primarily focused on implementing those provisions of the Revitalized Peace Agreement that outline elite power sharing arrangements rather than those that would promote accountability, facilitate a smoother delivery of humanitarian assistance and strengthen financial management and overall governance. The parties agreed that 35 per cent of the appointments to the Revitalized Transitional Government of Nati onal Unity would be women, but that provision has not been adhered to in the appointment of cabinet ministers and governors. The current economic crisis in South Sudan has decimated the resources and resilience of its population and made it more difficult for the Government to finance many aspects of the peace process. More fundamentally, the parties have not demonstrated sufficient political will to address issues critical to longer term peace and security. Based on the past record of the parties involved, international donors have been reluctant to finance the implementation of the Revitalized Peace Agreement, fearing that funds will be used to fuel violence rather than foster peace. Therefore, while the Revitalized Peace Agreement and an earlier 2017 cessation of hostilities agreement have been successful in curbing large scale political violence and bringing most parties to the conflict into dialogue, they have not transformed the underlying dynamics that contributed to the outbreak of civil war in South Sudan. The country continues to be destabilized by an oversized and dysfunctional security sector and remains awash with small arms and light weapons. Few economic opportunities exist outside the civil service and the war economy, leaving young people vulnerable to recruitment by armed groups. While violence directly attributable to the parties to the civil war has ebbed, intercommunal violence has risen sharply over the past year and, in many cases, has been directly fuelled by national political actors as an extension of political tensions and disputes. Human rights violations have continued unabated, with deeply concerning restrictions on civil society and media organizations. Moreover, violence could escalate in the lead up to elections, which are expected to take place in 2022 or 2023. In short, while advances have been made, South Sudan has not yet reached a point where continued progress is assured, where peace is stable or where civilians are benefiting from the agreements reached on paper. Opportunities, progress and the contribution of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan to peace and security There are some opportunities for progress in South Sudan. Although the implementation of the Revitalized Peace Agreement has been limited, it has been successful in that it has brought most political parties in the country together in an ongoing process of dialogue and fostered agreement, at least on paper, on the way forward. The Agreement contains a road map for durable change in the country. Th e national dialogue, as a parallel track two peace process, has presented citizens with a much needed opportunity to discuss the root causes of violence and make recommendations on how the broad commitments enshrined in the Agreement should be implemented to address conflict drivers. More generally, the South Sudanese population is exhausted by war, broadly supportive of peace efforts and eager for opportunities to rebuild and experience the dividends of peace. While institutions at the local level are weak and the authority of community leaders has been threatened by displacement and years of conflict, there is also a history of local negotiation and peace agreements that can be built upon. In the short term, local peace agreements can improve trust and prevent or reduce levels of violence. In the medium term, there is some potential for local peace agreements to trickle up. In this environment, rife with challenges but not without opportunities, UNMISS has been able to contribute concretely to peace and security. Many stakeholders who were consulted agreed that the Mission’s work to ensure security at sites for the protection of civilians has undoubtedly saved lives, while its increasingly integrated and mobile patrols likewise have contributed to an improvement in the physical protection of civilians. Moreover, the Mission has increasingly been linking subnational dialogue activities with political analysis and outreach, thereby making those activities more effective. In efforts to improve the inclusivity and sustainability of the peace process and expand civic space, UNMISS has supported the development of political parties and hosted a series of grass roots dialogues for which it has brought civil society actors from around the country to Juba. The Mission has worked with humanitarian and development agencies to increase awareness of sexual and gender based violence, conflict related sexual violence and the rights of all civilians, including women and children. In the course of the review, Mission officials noted that the rapid investigation team created within the UNMISS Human Rights Division has enabled it to more quickly deploy and scale up capacity for investigating human rights violations, including conflict related sexual violence. In addition, a wide range of interlocutors recognized that the UNMISS Rule of Law Advisory Section had made important contributions to improving accountability through its support for mobile courts, training and technical advice to South Sudanese stakeholders in legal reforms. Humanitarian and development actors also widely affirmed that the presence and activities of UNMISS contributed to an environment conducive to the delivery of humanitarian assistance. There was broad agreement among the interlocutors of the review team that there was a direct link between justice, accountability and sustainable peace, and, therefore, that renewed efforts were needed to achieve justice for past crimes. Chapter V of the Revitalized Peace Agreement contains a road map for the parties and the African Union Commission to establish a body to be known as the Hybrid Court for South Sudan. Negotiations between the African Union Commission and the Government of South Sudan on the establishment of the Court have reached an advanced stage, but n o agreement has thus far been signed. Given the divided support for the establishment of the Court, continued international engagement would be needed to reduce delays and keep the process on track. Ideally, that effort would be led by the African Union with support from bodies of the United Nations system. Recommendations for the reconfiguration of the Mission After considering the environment in South Sudan and the Mission’s demonstrated past performance, the review team concluded that the current four pillars of the Mission’s mandate remain valid overall. However, a number of adjustments to its mandate, activities and capabilities within those four pillars would enhance the Mission’s impact. Moreover, it is critical that the United Nations, in particular UNMISS, enhance its role in support of the IGAD led peace process. This is all the more necessary as the countries of the region are facing their own internal challenges and may not be able to devote the same level of attention to South Sudan as they have in the past. Throughout the review, the team was cognizant of the primacy of politics in the pursuit of lasting peace in South Sudan. Therefore, the team strove to identify methods of increasing political leverage to help to move the process forward, without losing sight of the reality that fundamental and structural changes can only be brought about if South Sudanese stakeholders fully own the process and demonstrate political will. No amount of external pressure or support can substitute that requirement. In so doing, the review team built on the Secretary General’s priorities to deepen partnerships between the United Nations and the African Union and enhance integration within the United Nations system. In practical terms, the review team recommends establishing a strong compact with the region and the African Union, including its relevant specialized institutions. Building on the significant level of coordination that already exists between the Mission and the wider United Nations system on one hand and the African Union and IGAD on the other, more should be done to develop common messaging and joint advocacy with those two regional actors on the different aspects of the UNMISS mandate and the implementation of the Revitalized Peace Agreement, such as the Mission’s freedom of movement and humanitarian access. Furthermore, the normative and policy framework that the African Union has developed over the past two decades on issues of governance, human rights and elections can help to overcome challenges related to the political will and the capacity of South Sudanese actors and institutions. Overall, the objective is to broaden engagement rather than relegate concerns to bilateral exchanges between the United Nations and South Sudan. The region and Africa as a whole will benefit tremendously from the stabilization of South Sudan. Consequently, they have an enormous stake in the success of UNMISS. Second, existing United Nations resources in the region, namely the United Nations Office to the African Union and the Office of the Special Envoy of the Secretary General for the Horn of Africa, should be utilized more effectively so as to strengthen engagement with the African Union and those of its member States that are directly involved in the peace process. Doing so will help to keep those actors fully informed of the Mission’s efforts and facilitate the mobilization of their support as necessary. Similarly, resources at United Nations Headquarters should be leveraged to their fullest.","['Drought', 'Epidemic', 'Flood', 'Other']"

"Five million people in Pakistan have been affected by severe monsoon floods that have destroyed or damaged nearly one million homes, according to the UN Children’s agency UNICEF . UNICEF says the floods have been “a double disaster” for children and is calling for more help to reach them before the situation worsens. Pakistan is still recovering from floods a year ago which left 20 million people homeless. Kristen Elsby is from UNICEF in Pakistan. “This is really a double disaster for the children of Pakistan. Over 2.5 million children have been affected by this year’s floods in Sindh Province alone and many of them actually come from the same areas that were hit by last year’s floods. We know that there are more than 100,000 children in over 2,200 camps in the province, especially in the hardest hit districts.” Duration 23” Listen to the media http www.unmultimedia.org radio english 2011 09 floods affect 5 million people in pakistan .","['Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Mud Slide']"
" HIGHLIGHTS New data by the Secretariat of Food Security and Nutrition SESAN has increased the caseload from 34,158 households to 47,196 households approx. 242,490 individuals . On October, there have been significant amounts of rainfall in much of the country. INSIVUMEH, reports that landslides could affect the country, especially the western region. Nevertheless, the drought spell between June and August may have had irreversible effects on the harvest due during the 3rd quarter of 2012 to be confirmed by EFSA results . The National Institute for Seismology, Vulcanology, Meteorology and Hydrology INSIVUMEH reports that in the months of July and August 2012, Guatemala was affected by a meteorological drought a high degree of dryness which, to date, has affected 18 out of the 22 departments in the country. The drought has ruined half of this year's crops of the two main staples in the affected areas, maize and beans, and early estimates reported by the Ministry of Agriculture MAGA show losses of at least US 10 million. According to early analysis by WFP and its partners, the departments most impacted by the drought are Jalapa, El Progreso, Zacapa, Santa Rosa, Guatemala, Sacatepéquez, Chimaltenango, Baja Verapaz, Sololá, Quiché, Suchitepequez, Quetzaltenango, Totonicapan, Retalhuleu, and Huehuetenango. ￼￼￼ Contributions are urgently needed to enable WFP to have an adequate food stock in case an emergency afflicts Guatemala. The Ministry of Health expects to see a slight increase in acute malnutrition in most parts of the country in the following months.","['Drought', 'Heat Wave']"

However, communication costs continue to be a problem and installation of a computer network within the delegation is a priority. On the road, new vehicles are also needed. Delegate positions, especially in health, need to be filled and these vacancies are hampering programme implementation. A long awaited health review, scheduled for late August, should improve future activities. p td tr table div p Operational Developments p p Initial problems regarding drug distribution early in the winter months did not severely delay the distribution of medical supplies to health institutions. The distribution of coal for heating of 24 hospitals was effective there was an increase of 50 70 patients being treated in acceptable conditions. The water and sanitation project has encourage the National Society NS to develop a wat san unit at headquarters level. The Government has recognized the work by the Red Cross and has been very supportive in the planning process of the next phase of the water and sanitation project. The Red Cross capacity in Disaster Preparedness has increased, whereby a first coordination meeting was held with participants from UN agencies, the Federation and Government indicating a joint cooperation in Disaster Response p p Disaster Response p p class c2 Typhoon Relief Operation p p Typhoon Prapiroon Tropical Storm No.12 hit the Northeast coast of the DPRK late on 30 August 2000. As a result of quick response to the victims in South Hamhung Province the following was achieved during the operational period p ul type disc li Provided 12,000 blankets to typhoon affected population. li li Provided 2,400 cooking sets to affected families. li li Provided 12,000 jackets and shoes each to the affected people. li li 10 rolls of plastic sheeting provided in two district only. li li 3,607 container of water purification tablets has provided to all the affected areas. li li 149 cartoons of high energy BP 5 biscuits provided. li li 120 First Aid kits provided to cover all the affected areas. li ul br b Wat San initiatives in typhoon affected areas b p Although there were no outbreaks of water borne diseases, it was reported that the water conditions were significantly worsened after the typhoon disaster. Water purification tablets were distributed and the boiling of water only served as a short term solution. During the harsh winter months it was impossible to assess the WAT SAN situation for the most vulnerable people residing in the typhoon affected areas. However the situation was assessed in April. Shortly after, procurement of water pipes and accessories had been received. However transportation to targeted areas is still on going. WAT SAN programme in South Hamgyong province commenced in July with a target completion date by end of September 2001. p p class c2 Monitoring p p Distribution plans were prepared by the Red Cross Society of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea RCSDPKR in cooperation with the Federation delegation. From February Field and DP Delegates have been traveling extensively to the region, visiting families beneficiaries and working with local Red Cross to monitor reporting tasks. Needs of beneficiaries were addressed during discussions with chiefs of cooperative farms, staff and volunteers of county and provincial RC branches. p p class c2 Constraints p p With the local population living on marginal food rations, the typhoon disaster brought further damage across the country to agriculture production, public building, land, industry, road and rail network. With restricted access to some affected locations due to road washouts and destroyed bridges, the regions were also affected by lack of raw materials, electricity and fuel. Most reconstruction was undertaken by manual labour and materials were transported by ox or bull cart. p p This winter has been the harshest since 1949, restricting transportation, further delaying the programme. p p class c2 BP 5 Distribution p p Stocks of BP 5 biscuits were stored in 4 regional warehouses donated by Norwegian Red Cross. To best utilize those fit for consumption, a proposal was made by NS and approved by Federation to distribute the balance. With data supplied by local RC branches and health authorities it was agreed 1,543 cartons be distributed to 27 nurseries and 14 kindergartens in 5 provinces. A total of 5,218 beneficiaries. p p An instruction manual was also handed out in Korean so that correct use could be made to the beneficiaries. Monitoring was conducted during distribution by Federation DP and Field Delegates. p p Disaster Preparedness p p class c2 Objectives p ul type disc li To further improve disaster preparedness and response structures and systems at national, provincial and county level. li li To improve the human resource base needed for disaster preparedness and response in the DPRK Red Cross li li To increase awareness of disaster risks and the coping mechanisms of the population in high risk areas. li li To develop an effective warehouse system and to pre position emergency relief items in strategic locations to assist some 30,000 people to develop mechanisms for the rapid mobilization of emergency relief items. li ul br b DP DR Training Workshop b ul type disc li 2 days workshop for 22 Participants were conducted by the DP RD from NS in the South Hamgyong. li li 3 day DP DR Training workshop for 30 Participants from different Counties City of North Pyongan Province. li ul br b The main objectives were b ul type disc li To strengthen the National Society’s capacity in terms of skill and knowledge li li Provide basic knowledge on DP DR as well as dissemination of Red Cross principles to heighten the profile of Red Cross. li li Establishing a disaster preparedness plan and response. li li Other topics include VCA, Sphere, CBDP, Red Cross and Red Crescent movement, and CBFA. li ul br b Translation of Sphere Project b p The Federation Delegation supported the integration of the Sphere Humanitarian Charter and Minimum Standards in Disaster Response into the training programme. The Sphere documentation has been translated into Korean language and will soon be printed. p p class c2 Developed and Translation of Training Module p p The training module on Basic Disaster Preparedness and Response has been developed into the Korean context by the Federation Delegation. It has been shared with the NS DP DR Department, after the finalization, the training module will be translated into Korean language for distribution. p p class c2 Geographical coverage and hazard risk mapping p p The South Hamgyong Province was previously a non operational area for Red Cross, after the experience of typhoon disaster this province included in the programme for 2001. p p The data available on hazards, their frequency, geographical distribution, vulnerable population, exiting capacity were very limited. Therefore the National Society has drawn up hazard risk maps based on the historical recollection of disasters over the past few years including recent typhoons. p p class c2 Recruitment of DP officers for provincial branches p p The recruitment of 15 DP officers is currently in process. p p class c2 DP DR Joint meeting between UN agencies, FDRC and Red Cross p p Initiated by the Federation NS, on 14 June 2001 at RCSDPRK, a joint meeting between UN agencies, the Flood Damage Rehabilitation Committee FDRC , and Red Cross was held, to prepare a common contingency plan for future disasters. Present were WFP, UNDP, UNICEF and OCHA. NS took a lead in this meeting and issues discussed were risk mapping, VCA, early warning system, communication, current stock, and establishment of working group and DP training. WFP showed keen interest in providing food for stock piling in RC warehouses. An agreement between WFP Federation NS should be reached. Once this agreement is reached WFP will provide the food for stockpiling. This will be entirely emergency food stock. p p class c2 Current Emergency Stocks p p In strategic location to assist 30,000 people. p ul type disc li Food 424 metric tonnes li li Blanket 34,461 li li Cooking Set 1,147 li li Plastic Sheeting 123 Rolls 389 Bales li li Water Containers 6,000. li li Water Tank 20 Kits li li Water Purification Tablets 3.5 million li li First Aid Kit 856 Boxes li li Winter Jacket 3,260 li ul br b Equipment for the emergency rescue and relief measures b ul type disc li Hospital Tent 19 li li Rubber Boat inc. motor 8 li li Water Pump 5 Kits li li Life Jacket 90 li li Safe Helmet 1,520 li li First Aid Helmet 600 li li First Aid Waistcoat 600 li li Rubb Hall storage tent 1 Kit li ul br b Constraints b p The DP DR department needs further training as well as more staff at headquarters and provincial branches. Also, the lack of public awareness on DP DR should be addressed. However, after several training workshop volunteers and staff members have a clearer concept of DP DR. p p class c2 Exchange visit to Nepal Red Cross by DP personnel of RCSDPRK p p To facilitate sharing of knowledge, skills and experience in Disaster Preparedness, the Federation and RCSDPRK arranged a two week training visit to Nepal Red Cross Society in June July for three members of the DP department and for the Federation DP Delegate 2001. Areas of focus during the visit included Disaster Preparedness Planning, Emergency Contingency Planning, CBDP, Response Mechanism, Warehouse Management, Human Resource and Organizational Development, Linked between disaster and development, and Warehousing techniques. p p Health and Care p p class c2 Drug Distribution Project p p class c5 Objective 1 p ul type disc li To improve general health care for outpatients by providing basic medicines and medical supplies to 1,690 public health facilities at county hospital, ri village level hospital and ri clinic level in the four Red Cross operational areas in 2001 and 2002. li li To increase the professional knowledge and skills of government staff working at health facilities by providing them with updated medical guidelines and training in the rational use of drugs and standard treatment schedules, in close cooperation with WHO and the Ministry of Health MoH in 2001 and 2002. li ul br This year the project is covering 49 counties in 3 provinces and 1 municipality North and South Pyongan, Chagang and Kaesong . International organizations gained access to one new county in South Pyongan province from November 2000, and this county has been included in the project. The Red Cross operational area covers 3 Provincial hospitals, 64 City county hospitals, 79 Industrial hospitals, 294 Ri hospitals, 88 Poly clinics and 1178 Ri clinics which are receiving drugs and medical supplies every 3 months. p The distributions in November December 2000 covered the consumption in first quarter 2001. Due to late incoming drugs, 16 county industrial hospitals and 213 Ri clinics did not receive any drug kits. p p The distribution in March 2001 was divided in two phases due to problems concerning storage and transportation of drugs in the winter season. Because some of the drugs had been exposed to subzero temperatures, three injectable drugs were removed from 59 county hospital kits and one drug from 293 Ri hospital kits after consultations with the supplier. p p class c2 Distribution overview January June 2001 p table border 1 tr valign top td width 130 rowspan 2 div class c3 Provinces div td td width 127 rowspan 2 div class c3 Date div td td width 130 rowspan 2 div class c4 b Number of kits b br b units b div td td width 125 rowspan 2 div class c4 b Distributed to b br b institutions b div td td width 115 rowspan 2 div class c3 Donor div td tr tr td td tr tr valign top td width 130 rowspan 7 North Pyongan, br Chagang, South br Pyongan, Kaesong td td width 127 rowspan 7 Distribution br March 16.

Institutions, due to lack of coal, had many closed inpatient departments, especially in Ri hospitals. It was reported that most of the treatment was carried out in homes by household doctors and hospital specialists. In hospitals where coal was supplied, the number of inpatients increased by at least 50 . p p Also some hospital pharmacies had problems with heating, and in a few institutions frozen drugs were seen by delegates. In June priority has been given to monitoring of County and Industrial hospitals to follow up the distribution of surgical instruments kits. In general, the level of activity in hospitals has increased compared to the winter months. The delegates experience free access to whatever institution they wanted to visit, given 5 days warning. On a few occasions delegates has been allowed to visit patients’ homes. In total 216 health institutions and warehouses have been monitored by Federation delegates during the period under review. In addition the NS field monitors have visited 580 health institutions. p p class c2 Sterilisers p p This year’s distribution of 221 sterilisers covered the last part of a general distribution to all hospitals. The sterilisers can be heated by any energy source, and have been highly appreciated by the hospital staff. p p class c2 Surgical instruments p p The last supply of surgical instruments from MOPH is reported to have taken place 5 to 20 years ago according to the directors and surgeons in different hospitals. The present distribution consists of general instruments for abdominal and soft tissue surgery. The discussions with the directors and surgeons about the composition of the instrument kit have been open and they have expressed their high appreciation for the instruments. More specialized instruments for abdominal surgery have been requested by the surgeons. Many of the old instruments delegates have seen have been rusty and outworn. The needle holders and forceps have had very bad grips. Both represent risk factors during operations. p p In addition to what is distributed in the medical kits, and small and irregular quantities distributed by MOPH, there are uncovered demands for anesthetics amounting to an increase of 50 in comparison to the present supply. These needs are covered by general analgesics, morphine and Koryo drugs. This means that many patients probably still suffer from great pain undergoing surgical treatment. Delegates have not seen functioning gas anesthesia in the hospitals. There is a further need for surgical instruments such as gynecological obstetrics, pediatric and orthopedic instruments. p p class c2 Medical kits p p In all visited hospitals, the stock records have been well kept, and drugs have been on stock according to the stock cards. In general, there is good order in the pharmacies, and ergometrine has been stored in refrigerators. However, with the irregular power supply the quality of cold storage varies. In discussions with hospital doctors, there is uniform feedback that the most needed drugs are antibiotics, anaesthetics, antipyretics and anti inflammatory drugs. In general, the western drugs are said to cover 30 of the total consumption. The rest is covered by locally produced herbal medicines. The herbs are mostly collected by the institution staff themselves. p p class c2 Warehouse monitoring p p In general all visited warehouses are kept in good order and the waybills, stock cards and distribution plans are present and correctly filled out. Some warehouses are too hot in summer, but everybody claims to have refrigerators to store temperature sensitive drugs, at least in the county hospitals. p p class c2 Increased knowledge of government health staff p p The drug manual published last year by WHO, UNICEF and Red Cross is used in most of the health institutions visited. In general, it is emphasised that the skills of the doctors are sufficient, and that the problem is only the lack of supplies. p p A WHO supported project in MOPH is launched to produce a comprehensive handbook for primary health care doctors, covering topics in diagnosis, treatment and drugs. The Red Cross is now considering to support this project. p p class c2 Constraints p p There are three main constraints to meet the objective p ul type disc li Irregular supplies of medicines and medical supplies li li Temperature control in the storage and transportation of drugs li li Lack of access to basic data and constraints on random monitoring li ul br To ensure a better coordinated and regular supply of drugs, efforts have been made to increase dialogue with donors. Furthermore, representatives from both ECHO and governmental humanitarian offices have been invited to visit the delegation and Red Cross branches in the field to observe distributions and monitoring. p The temperature control of the central warehouse has been improved by acquiring a new warehouse. For the coming winter, efforts have been made to have the supplies arriving in DPRK early enough for distribution before the winter season commences. For storage in hospitals, ref. winterization, objective 3. p p The issue of random monitoring is raised with authorities regularly, both by the Federation and the Humanitarian Development Working Group. The Federation continues to actively support the National Society in its dialogue with the authorities in order to promote acceptance of information collection for monitoring and impact assessment. Nevertheless, relative to other agencies operating in DPRK, the Federation, due to its close partnership with the local Red Cross Society, has good access to institutions and vulnerable populations. p p An external review of the health program will be undertaken in August September 2001. p p Health promotion training p p class c5 Objective 2 To reduce the prevalence of a number of communicable diseases by improving the knowledge and skills of health workers and Red Cross volunteers in specific topics related to priority health care issues and concerns p p class c2 Diarrhoea Workshops p p Gastrointestinal disorders continues to be the most frequent disease reported by health institutions. Priority has therefore been given to conduct workshops on prevention and early treatment of diarrhoea. p p A total of 17 workshops for 355 participants have been conducted in all four provinces in the operational area in June and July. The participants are either Community Health Workers, First Aiders or workers in Nurseries Kindergartens. The curriculum and the training materials have been updated this year, and special emphasis is put on the use of ORS. The number of participants is approximately half men and half women. After the initial training, the entire workshops are now conducted by RCSDPRK staff, and with the delegates acting as facilitators only. p p All participants have been very active during the workshops. The Red Cross branches have requested training to be conducted more often. It seems, that Community Health workers and RC volunteers have a very important role in health promotion in the communities. An evaluation of the workshop is expected to be completed in July. p p class c2 Acute Respiratory Infections Workshops p p These workshops were planned for the winter season 2000 2001, however due to lack of delegates, they had to be postponed. The preparation of Flip charts and other materials for the workshops have been completed, and the workshops will start in September. p p class c2 Constraints p p A gap in availability of health delegates for missions to DPRK has resulted in resource shortage in the delegation. There are also constraints on availability of participants for training education workshops during the planting and harvesting seasons. p p Lack of indoor heating makes it impossible to conduct training in the months December March. p p Training is not sufficient to reduce the incidence of communicable diseases. Individuals also require access to safe water, appropriate sanitation services and energy for heating. p p A priority for the coming months is the establishment of closer coordination between health training and water and sanitation activities. p p class c2 Winterisation Project p p class c5 Objective 3 p ul type disc li To improve the operational capacity of health institutions in winter a four month season November, December 2001 January, February 2002, and November, December 2002 by providing coal for heating the operating theaters, emergency and outpatient areas of 66 provincial, county and city hospitals in 2001 and 2002. li li To improve conditions by providing plastic sheeting for repairing windows in 66 provincial, county and city hospitals in 2001. li ul br The heating health institutions programme was initiated with the objectives to provide coal to the hospitals for two months when treatment faces most difficulties in order to ul type disc li ensure minimum temperature, of 15 to 20°C for proper treatment of inpatients li li increase the admission rate to 70 of capacity and improve drug use efficiency. li ul br The Norwegian Red Cross agreed to contribute towards the procurement of coal for the winter 2000 2001, The coal was distributed to 22 city county hospitals and 2 provincial hospitals in North Pyongan Province and Kaesong Province, since coal was not at all available in those particular provinces. An agreement was signed between the Federation and DPRK Red Cross on 29 January 2001 which comprises of several points including random monitoring of the coal distribution. The Logistics team managed to secure the procurement of 2,028 MT of good quality coal locally at a favorable rate which were distributed as follows ul type disc li 2 Provincial Hospital X 222MT 2 months 444MT li li 22 County Hospital X 72MT 2 months 1,584MT li ul br The coal was delivered to the hospitals between 8 15 February 2001 as per the schedule. Monitoring trips were arranged starting from 13 February 2001. As of end March 2001, second or third round of monitoring had been done at 21 county hospitals and 2 provincial hospitals by the Federation delegates. The monitoring reports had been recorded in the standard format developed by the DPRK Federation Delegation. It was reported that the supply of coal was extremely helpful for the recuperation of the inpatients, especially psychologically, as well as the profile of Red Cross in the region. The number of patients were reported to be increased by more than two fold in all the hospitals where coal was supplied and the room temperature was between 15C to 25C. Previously the number of patients were dwindling during winter as the temperature in the hospital’s rooms and operation theaters were in many places as cold as 0°C to 5°C. Furthermore, the quality of the coal was extremely good which were appreciated by the hospital authorities. p class c2 Monitoring p p In addition to regular monitoring, the DP Delegate was able to conduct four random monitoring visits to four hospitals. Other delegates also assisted in monitoring this project by including coal in their agenda during their regular health monitoring visits. p p class c2 Water and Sanitation Project p p class c5 Objective 4 p ul type disc li To provide 81 ri hospitals with safe and clean water in 2001, as part of an ongoing project. li li To provide sufficient quantities of potable water for 300,000 beneficiaries in 30 villages through 300 water points, as from mid 2001. li li To build capacity to increase access to safe water, adequate sanitation and improved personal hygiene li li To train RCSDPRK counterparts, with the aim of creating a much needed water and sanitation unit within the RCSDPRK. li ul br b Rehabilitation of ri hospitals b p In the period January June 2001 the final part of 41 ri hospitals of the 3 year program for rehabilitation of water and sanitation system in 36 hospitals and 111 ri hospitals was executed. The aim was to improve the supply and hygiene conditions for patients and medical personnel by providing adequate water and sanitary conditions. p p The material for the last part was ordered in October 2000 and delivered in January 2001. Due to the cold winter with hard frozen ground no work could be implemented before March. The monitoring was carried out in Spring by three technicians and the Federation and DPRK RC water and sanitation specialists. The 41 projects were almost complete by the of June, only minor supplementing work have to be added in July. p p class c2 Education workshops p p The NS water sanitation unit are still weak in knowledge, but will improve with workshops based on a manual in basic water and sanitation which will be produced for participants from county Red Cross in the 4 provinces of Federation responsibilities. The remaining 8 provinces will be educated in the same way by the NS. Due to a shortage of time, the first workshop had to be moved from the last week of June to the first week of August. p p class c2 Community health and water sanitation delegation p p A Federation DPRK RC health and water sanitation design undertook a feasibility study design mission in May. The recommendation of the team was to change the direction of water and sanitation activities from rehabilitation in hospitals to rehabilitation of water and sanitation services in rural communities. A proposal for a community based water and sanitation and health promotion project will be launched in the 2002 03 Federation Appeal for DPRK. p p class c2 Chlorine distribution p p Of 25 metric tonnes of calcium hypochlorite, 65 have been distributed to 50 county hospitals or county Red Cross for further distribution to hospitals, ri hospitals and ri clinics. During monitoring visits to county warehouses, delegates have also monitored distribution of chlorine powder. Information has been provided to health institutions on further handling and distribution of the chlorine. p p class c2 CBFA Community Based First aid p p class c5 Objective 5 To provide timely, effective and efficient assistance to the community by improving the Community Based First Aid capability of the DPRK Red Cross, using a community based approach. This will incorporate an element drawing attention to the gender issue. p p After completion of the Master training in the autumn 2000, a first training of trainers TOT workshop was conducted in March with 20 participants from 20 Counties. All participants received Flip charts and handouts to enable them to conduct their Training of volunteers TOV . p p First TOV workshop was conducted in Sinuiju in June with 20 participants. The participants are working in 10 First Aid posts in Sinuiju county. The NS is highly interested in the CBFA project and they will train 400 participants 20 workshops, 20 participants in each during 2001. The original plan was to train 240 volunteers. First Aid material donated by Norwegian RC will be distributed to each First Aid Post participating in the training. Monitoring of the activities at the First Aid posts will be given high priority in the coming months. p p class c2 Malaria p p class c5 Objective 6 p p To decrease the incidence of malaria cases to minimize recurrent epidemics in the Red Cross operational areas in 2001 and 2002 through p ul type disc li Provision of sufficient anti malarial drugs Chloroquine Primaquine for 100,000 cases. li li Extensive health education for community health workers first aid workers. li ul br Malaria still seems to be the disease that causes most concern among people in the rural areas. With 73,000 reported cases in the Federation operational area last year, The Red Cross is providing drugs for 100 000 patients in 2001. Due to lack of diagnostic tests there are still uncertainties about the number of cases. However, this year WHO is providing 4.5 million tablets and a large amount of diagnostics and laboratory equipment together with bed nets to be distributed through MOPH. p Preparations are made to conduct 20 workshops for 400 Community Health Workers and Red Cross volunteers in July and August. p p class c2 Health Care Self sufficiency p p class c5 Objective 7 p p Through the NS, MOPH is regularly informed about the Red Cross program and the progress of the projects. Federation Health Coordinator together with his counterpart have meetings with representatives from the Ministry on major issues connected with the program. In these meetings possible future changes in the program are discussed, but so far the MOPH want a continuation of the Red Cross support at least at the same level. p p Due to the recurrent disasters they don’t see any possibility for increased support for the hospitals through the public distribution system. The present support from the Red Cross in the four provinces, enables the MOPH to direct their support to institutions in other parts of the country. Thus the present program has an indirect impact on vulnerable persons all over DPRK. p p So far, there are no indications that the MOPH has plans for reforming the health system. Federation delegation has asked MOPH for a meeting regarding possible better access to morbidity data which can give indications on the impact of the program. There is regular contact with health professionals from WHO and UNICEF to coordinate the support and to utilize local production of ORS. p p Institutional and Resource Development p p Following discussions with the NS in the second half of 2000 an initial document on Organisational Resource Development OD RD was submitted to the Secretariat. In February an assessment planning team headed by the OD RD delegate in Bangkok Regional Delegation visited DPRK and prepared a proposal for a three year program. This program will be launched in the 2002 03 Federation Appeal for DPRK. The first workshop held in DPRK Red Cross on Governance Management was conducted in early July 2001. p p class c2 Regional Cooperation p p Through close cooperation with the Regional Delegation in Beijing the DPRK delegation is provided with logistics support like visitor service, administrative matters and some procurement. The country delegation has also been supported by the Regional Delegation in Bangkok regarding programming and training of NS staff in the fields of OD RD and communication training p p Coordination and Management p p class c5 Objective 1 To continue to provide coordinated support and assistance to DPRK Red Cross for the planning and implementation of the programmes to be supported by the Federation. p p A planning meeting to discuss the process for the development of the CAS was held in Beijing. This was followed by a draft CAS which was submitted to the Secretariat for comment. A further draft is being prepared for distribution to all partners for their input. The development of the DPRK RC development plan is also ongoing. p p The system developed within the DPRK operation was to provide informal operational reports to Geneva and the Participating National Societies PNSs was interrupted for some months in the beginning of the year due to Secretariat constraints. However, this has been overcome in the latter months. Indications are that these reports are well received by the PNSs. Donor reports submitted to the Secretariat have unfortunately not reached the targeted donor in timely manner. This has in some cases caused dissatisfaction to the PNSs concerned. p p The main coordination of international support is carried out by the Desk in the Secretariat. However efforts through a number of contacts by the delegation and NS have proven to be effective to some extent. Visiting officials from various donor countries have been received and briefed by HOD and NS on Red Cross activities. p p Visits in 2000 to numerous embassies in Beijing by HOD have since been followed up in this period under review. p p A Swedish Red Cross Society delegation visited DPRK in March and a Norwegian Red Cross Society delegation visited in June. p p Ongoing issues regarding the Status Agreement for the Federation in DPRK is still unresolved but discussions continue with the relevant government bodies. p p class c5 Objective 2 To ensure that the resources contributed to programmes of the DPRK Red Cross are effectively targeted and efficiently used. p p Initial slow financial support from the donor to the programmes has by mid year been improved. With support from Kuala Lumpur, the delegation is able to follow the pattern of income and expenditure as required. p p The NS financial section has expressed interest in strengthening their financial management system. However, due to internal time and availability by both delegation and NS staff this has yet to take place. p p class c5 Objective 3 To promote the work of DPRK Red Cross among the donor community in DPRK, and the domestic and international audiences. p p Donor representatives present in DPRK participate regularly in the weekly interagency meeting chaired by the Humanitarian Coordinator. At these meetings the HOD gives a brief report on the program achievements and in special cases approach the donors on more specific matters. In close cooperation with the NS several field visits for donors have been arranged during the period under review. The Deputy Head of Swedish SIDA visited DPRK and participated in a field trip to Mundock to observe the ongoing Red Cross wat san project. Likewise field trips have been arranged for the Norwegian Ambassador in Beijing, the British Ambassador in DPRK and representatives from the Finish embassy in Beijing. In connection to the visit of the Chairman of EU, several representatives from the international media were briefed on Red Cross programmes and met with senior representatives of the NS. Efforts have been made to invite media representatives to DPRK to follow the work of the Red Cross, however clearance by the Government for such visits has so far not been granted. p p class c5 Objective 4 To mobilize the required resources for the implementation of the programmes p p Due to the additional workload on the desk in the secretariat during the India earthquake operation, many of the regular contacts with donors were unfortunately interrupted. Hence, a slow response to the appeal has been the case in the first part of the year. This has lately been overcome and the coverage of the appeal looks at the moment encouraging. p p class c5 Objective 5 To support capacity building p p Several of NS staff have participated in workshops and training abroad in various subjects e.g. health administration, Humanitarian Law and Disaster Preparedness. The previous heavy turnover of NS staff has to some extend been reduced, hence the capacity amongst the various counterparts has increased. However, staff rotation after training has caused instability in the capacity building. p p class c6 For further details please contact Aurelia Balpe, Phone 41 22 7304 352 Fax 41 22 733 03 95 email

" VANUA LAVA VOLCANO 13°80’S 167°47’E Summit 3021ft 921m Current Vanuatu Volcano Alert Level Level 1 Vanua Lava volcano is continuing in the unrest state. The Volcanic Alert Level remains at Level 1. The volcanic unrest continues at Vanua Lava. The volcanic activity is likely to continue at similar level, consistent with the Volcanic Alert Level 1. Volcanic hazards remain on the volcanic cone and sulfur river e.g. volcanic gases . Danger Zone for life safety is limited around the volcanic cone and the sulfur river. Observations confirm ongoing presence of volcanic gases near the volcano and around the sulfur river. Gas smell will continue while approaching the volcanic area. The Volcanic Alert Level for Vanua Lava volcano has been at the Level 1 since 27th May 2016. The current observations are consistent with the activity of the Volcanic Alert Level 1. Level 1 indicates ‘Minor level of unrest Danger Zone is near the volcanic area and the sulfur river’ . Vanua Lava volcano is one of the active volcano in Vanuatu and in contrast to other large volcanoes in the country, it does not contain a youthful summit caldera. A chain of small stratovolcanoes, oriented along a NNE SSW line, gives the low angle volcano an irregular profile. Historically, this volcano had low infrequent activity except in XIX century with 3 moderate manifestations and in XX century with 2. All tourism agencies, visitors, local authorities, and people from Vanua Lava Island and general public are reminded that due to the current volcanic activity, the danger zone remains at around the sulfur river and volcano area. In these areas, volcanic gases will always be expected. Visitors may expect impact of this gas while approaching these two areas. The Vanuatu Meteorology and Geohazards Department will closely monitor this volcano activity. More information will be provided accordingly when necessary. For further information, please contact Geohazards Division at the Vanuatu Meteorology and Geohazards Department at geohazards meteo.gov.vu or 24686.",['Volcano']

The Red Cross Society of China RCSC with its extensive network of branches throughout the nation has been responding to the floods with both preparatory measures and relief efforts, including both food and nonfood items delivered to those affected by the disasters. Rice, tents, clothing and blankets have been provided to those most severely affected by floods this year. p Still many families are awaiting news or funding on the reconstruction of their damaged or destroyed homes. The government of China is working with local authorities and families to secure some portion of assistance, but it is generally not enough to cover the extreme expense of rebuilding for those low income families who have lost their homes and possessions completely. p With the onset of winter encroaching already, the Red Cross Society of China is already beginning the reconstruction efforts in a number of villages. Beneficiaries, who will be selected from among the most vulnerable communities, are participating in the tendering and selection process and will receive a Federation grant for building materials to reconstruct their homes, in addition to a smaller local government grant and the offer of an interest free loan from the bank, negotiated by the government on behalf of these low income families.

KEY DEVELOPMENTS Storm Impacts Expected to Contribute to Increased Food Insecurity in Central America As a result of the extensive damage to crops, livestock, and livelihoods from Hurricanes Eta and Iota, coupled with pre existing vulnerabilities, the Famine Early Warning Systems Network FEWS NET estimates that at least 3 million people are currently facing Crisis—IPC 3—levels of acute food insecurity in Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. 1 Storm related impacts have exacerbated existing food insecurity, driven by several years of poor rainfall and the socioeconomic effects of the coronavirus disease COVID19 pandemic, in parts of rural northeastern Nicaragua, the Caribbean basin of Honduras, and northern and eastern Guatemala, in addition to the Central American Dry Corridor. Eta and Iota arrived at the peak of the agricultural labor season in the region and resulted in damage to more than 494,000 acres of staple food and cash crops, livestock losses, and destruction of fishing equipment the full extent of damage from Iota is still being assessed. While local governments and relief agencies are providing assistance to address the immediate food needs of storm affected populations, existing efforts are unlikely to meet the medium to long term needs of affected households. FEWS NET projects that an even higher number of people in the region will face Crisis outcomes through the peak of the lean season in August 2021, with access to food and income particularly limited among small scale farmers and other poor households until the harvest season begins in September 2021.","['Epidemic', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Tropical Cyclone']"
" HIGHLIGHTS ERC O’Brien highlights depth of humanitarian crisis in Yemen at UN General Assembly event GoUK, UN, and OIC announce an additional 100 million to support relief activities in Yemen Violence escalates NGO suspends operations due to increased insecurity KEY DEVELOPMENTS Conflict—including ground fighting between Republic of Yemen Government RoYG and Al Houthi forces, and airstrikes by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia KSA led Coalition —continued through mid September, resulting in additional civilian deaths and further destruction of public infrastructure. Fighting has resulted in approximately 10,000 deaths since conflict began in March 2015, with KSA led Coalition airstrikes accounting for nearly 60 percent of the reported deaths, according to UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator RC HC Jamie McGoldrick in media reports. The humanitarian crisis in Yemen is among the worst in the world, according to remarks by UN Under Secretary General and Emergency Relief Coordinator ERC Stephen O’Brien at an event during the UN General Assembly UNGA on September 21. O’Brien highlighted the need for safe humanitarian access and called on all parties to comply with international humanitarian and human rights law. In an August 31 UN Security Council UNSC briefing, UN Special Envoy for Yemen Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed expressed concern about the breakdown of the cessation of hostilities agreement reached in April, noting that the escalation in fighting since early August has led to additional civilian casualties and increased humanitarian needs. On September 18, RoYG President Abd Rabbu Mansur Hadi ordered the Central Bank of Yemen CBY to relocate from the Al Houthi controlled capital city of Sana’a to the RoYG–held city of Aden. Relocation of the CBY could have humanitarian and economic consequences, according to international media. On September 6, Médecins du Monde MDM —a non governmental organization NGO providing emergency medical assistance to vulnerable populations in Ibb and Sana’a governorates—temporarily suspended operations and withdrew staff from Sana’a due to increased attacks. MDM is the second NGO to suspend activities in acutely conflict affected areas in recent weeks on August 18, Médecins Sans Frontières withdrew from six hospitals in Hajjah and Sa’dah due to insecurity.","['Epidemic', 'Insect Infestation']"

"Highlights Mauritania is the single largest recipient of refugees fleeing the conflict in Mali. 74,108 refugees are living in the Mbéra camp. 60 of the refugees are children and many have been in the camp for over a year, resulting in overlapping emergency and medium term needs. A storm damaged school tents and child friendly spaces and as the rainy season commences, there is a higher risk of diseases including malaria and diarrhoeal disease. UNICEF, in coordination with UNHCR and partners, are providing education in the camp for 7,070 children 49 girls in six schools and psychosocial stimulation for 1,152 children at four child friendly spaces. In 2013, 1,175 children have been treated for Severe Acute Malnutrition SAM by UNICEF and others. Communities hosting the refugees are very poor and suffer high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition. UNICEF is helping to reinforce basic services, including malnutrition treatment. In 2013, the expected national caseload of Global Acute Malnutrition GAM is 122,719 children under five years, including 23,901 cases of SAM. The post harvest GAM prevalence was 5.6 and is expected to increase significantly in the summer lean season. Preventative blanket feeding, cash transfers and programmes to build longer term resilience are being implemented alongside life saving nutrition interventions providing therapeutic food and medicines.

"Cassandra Murtagh 23 July 2020 Life changing women’s groups provide mutual support and safe spaces for women and girls affected by conflict and drought in Ethiopia. But the COVID 19 pandemic means that large groups can no longer meet, yet the women have come up with an innovative way to continue to provide support to each other. “After I took on this responsibility, I felt what empowerment really means” says Alima Ali, a 25 year old mother of two in Southern Ethiopia. “I was able to share important life saving knowledge and skills to my community”. Alima is speaking of her women’s group, and how empowered she felt after she became a leader in this group. Alima is one of over 600 women who are members of women’s groups in Southern Ethiopia, many of whom have experienced violence and extreme hardship. The groups have been set up to provide a safe space for these women and girls to gather together and to share their concerns. The groups have had a huge impact on the women in this troubled area near the Kenya border, where almost 200,000 people have been forced from their homes in recent years due to conflict and drought. Trócaire and our local partners have been working in the Borena Zone region to provide humanitarian assistance and protection services to the most vulnerable communities. In particular, women and girls in displaced communities face huge burdens, and can be left on the fringes of society. Traditional gender roles are very entrenched here. During gatherings where men and women are together, if a man stands up to speak, the women are expected to turn their backs and not look at the man while he is speaking. So these groups are really important, so that women have a safe space to share their concerns, get critical information and seek support. Currently there are 25 safe space groups for women in the area. However, these important life changing groups are now under threat due to the COVID 19 pandemic, as large groups can now longer gather safely. ‘A RAY OF LIGHT THAT SPARKLES THROUGH DARKNESS’ Before COVID 19, Alima’s support group met once a fortnight. They are encouraged to talk about their experiences in a supportive environment. For many of these women this has been the first time in their lives that they have been able to express themselves openly. The name of Alima’s women’s group is Angasu. This translates as ‘a ray of light that sparkles through darkness’ in the local Oromo language. Angasu is a life line for many community members. As well as psychological support, group members take it in turns to gather firewood and water for each other. They help elderly, disabled community members and new mothers with household chores. The women even construct and fix houses for other community members. ADAPTING DURING THE PANDEMIC In March, the Ethiopian government banned large gatherings of people and instituted social distancing measures due to the COVID 19 pandemic. Group members feared that Angasu would be in danger of closing. This would cut off this invaluable support system for women and girls in the area. To prevent this from happening, with help from Trócaire and our local partner organisation Oromia Pastoralist Association, Angasu members changed how they operated. They adopted new procedures to allow groups to meet and share important COVID 19 information with other community members. Alima says there was a lot of misinformation about the pandemic, saying that ‘some think the virus drops from the sky like rain’. Angasu now choose four representatives to support other members by organising small group sessions on COVID 19 prevention and hygiene. In this way they avoid meeting in a large group, but the representatives then make sure that all the relevant information reaches everyone in the group. Through thinking creatively, and turning one large group into a wider support network of smaller groups, these incredible support groups can continue to operate. As these women continue to recover from the effects of conflict, and stay resilient during a global pandemic, that is indeed a ray of light in the darkness. These safe spaces for women in Ethiopia are an example of how impactful overseas aid projects can be. Our ‘Build Back Better’ campaign is calling on Ireland to protect our aid budget.

"Madam President, Distinguished Members of the Security Council, I thank Council members for the opportunity to brief you this morning. I am aware of reports that certain public health facilities are in areas impacted by armed conflict putting the safety of those facilities at risk. I appeal to all parties in this conflict to ensure the safety of all such facilities in Ukraine. I am aware of media reports regarding allegations of biological weapons programmes. The United Nations is not aware of any biological weapons programmes. That is largely thanks to the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, which prohibits the development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use of biological and toxin weapons. The Russian Federation and Ukraine are both States Parties to the Convention. In addition, the Russian Federation is a Depositary Government under the Convention. All States Parties to the Convention have undertaken “never in any circumstances to develop, produce, stockpile or otherwise acquire or retain” biological weapons. Biological weapons have been outlawed since the BWC entered into force in 1975. A total of 183 States have now joined the Convention and biological weapons are universally seen as being abhorrent and illegitimate. The BWC lacks a multilateral verification mechanism overseen by an independent organization such as the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Therefore, assessing compliance with its obligations is a task for its States Parties. Madam President, Despite the lack of an international verification regime, the Biological Weapons Convention does however contain several measures to which concerned States Parties can have recourse in order to address situations in which States Parties have concerns or suspicions about the activities of their peers. For example, Article V of the Convention states that The States Parties to this Convention undertake to consult one another and to co operate in solving any problems which may arise in relation to the objective of, or in the application of the provisions of, the Convention. Within the framework of Article V, States Parties have established an annual exchange of information based upon the submission of “confidence building measures”. States Parties must declare information about relevant facilities and activities on their territory in order to “prevent or reduce the occurrence of ambiguities, doubts and suspicions” between them. The Russian Federation and Ukraine both participate annually in the “confidence building measures”. The annual reports submitted by the Russian Federation and Ukraine are available to all BWC States Parties for the purposes of transparency and re assurance. In addition, and also within the framework of Article V of the Convention, States Parties have developed procedures for clarifying ambiguous and unresolved matters , including the possible convening of a formal consultative meeting to consider such matters. Article VI of the Convention states that “Any State Party to this Convention which finds that any other State Party is acting in breach of obligations deriving from the provisions of the Convention may lodge a complaint with the Security Council”. If agreed by the Security Council, an investigation on the basis of the complaint received could be initiated. Article VI of the Convention has never been activated. While these provisions have not been regularly used, they are nonetheless internationally agreed procedures that are available to be used to defuse tensions and to address and resolve any concerns relating to compliance with obligations under the BWC in a multilateral setting. I would therefore encourage BWC States Parties to consider making use of the available procedures for consultation and cooperation in order to resolve these issues. Madam President, Distinguished Members of the Security Council, Situations such as this demonstrate the need to strengthen the BWC, to operationalize it and to institutionalize it. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to encourage its States Parties to come to the Convention’s Ninth Review Conference, scheduled to take place in Geneva later in 2022, committed to a serious overhaul of the Convention to ensure it is properly equipped and resourced to deal with the challenges ahead. Madam President, Distinguished Members of the Security Council, To conclude my statement, I would like to take this opportunity to address the worrying issue of the safety and security of nuclear power plants in Ukraine. An accident involving the nuclear facilities in Ukraine could have severe consequences for public health and the environment and all steps must be taken to avoid it. The possibility of an accident caused by failure to a reactor’s power supply or the inability to provide regular maintenance is growing by the day. The forces in effective control of nuclear power plants in Ukraine must ensure their safe and secure operation. I am extremely concerned that four of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s IAEA seven pillars for the safe and secure operation of facilities are reportedly not being implemented at Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhya. Communications must be fully restored, and operating staff must be allowed to properly carry out their duties and to do so free of undue pressure. I would like to echo the Secretary General’s support for IAEA Director General Grossi’s efforts to develop a framework to ensure the safety and security of Ukraine’s facilities and welcome the constructive meetings he held in Turkey on 10 March with the foreign ministers of Ukraine and the Russian Federation. I thank you very much for your attention.",['Technological Disaster']

"By Fan Xiaowen, Sichuan programme manager Weeks of heavy rain have led to severe flooding in China’s western Sichuan province. The area, which was badly affected by a 2008 earthquake, is now covered in floodwaters and faces the threat of worsening floods and landslides due to continuing heavy rains. Last week Save the Children launched a response to provide relief to the worst affected children and their families in Wenchuan and Bei Chuan counties. At least 100,000 people have been completely cut off in these mountainous areas of Sichuan province. Authorities reported that at least 68 people have died and 179 people are still missing. The experience must be extremely frightening for young children who live in the area and who are now surrounded by strong swirling currents of floodwaters that have blocked roads and inundated homes. The region’s most vulnerable children These are some of the poorest and most vulnerable children in the region, many living without their parents who have moved to the cities to find work, leaving them in the care of their grandparents. Save the Children, along with local partners, are working around the clock to respond to the needs of the families who have been hit hardest. We’re supporting the government’s rescue and relief work by providing families with toiletries, towels, children’s clothes and other essential items. Save the Children has been working in China for two decades and has responded to over 18 disasters in that time, including the 2010 Yushu earthquake and the earthquakes that hit Sichuan in 2008 and again in 2013, as well as the twin earthquakes in Yunnan Province in 2011. We were able to respond promptly to this disaster because of our Emergency Fund, which makes money available without us having to wait for a specific fund raising appeal at a point when time is absolutely vital.","['Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Severe Local Storm']"
"Countries in the Latin America and the Caribbean LAC region are vulnerable to a range of natural hazards, including droughts, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, landslides, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and wildfires, as well as economic and political crises. Between FY 2011 and FY 2020, USAID’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance USAID BHA provided humanitarian assistance in response to natural disasters and complex emergencies in the region through the former Office of Food for Peace USAID FFP and Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance USAID OFDA . Recent examples include Hurricane Dorian in The Bahamas, the ongoing complex emergency in Haiti, floods and landslides in El Salvador, wildfires in South America, and the Venezuela regional crisis. USAID provided approximately 1.2 billion to respond to disasters in the LAC region between FY 2011 and FY 2020. USAID BHA support included nearly 704.4 million for emergency food and nutrition assistance—through U.S. in kind food aid local, regional, and international food procurement cash transfers for food food vouchers and specialized nutrition products—to vulnerable populations, including indigenous communities, internally displaced persons, migrants, and refugees. USAID BHA assistance also included approximately 477 million for programs in agriculture economic recovery and market systems logistics support health humanitarian coordination, information management, and assessments multipurpose cash assistance nutrition protection shelter and settlements and water, sanitation, and hygiene. In the last decade, USAID responded to crises in 26 countries and territories in LAC, including to 73 declared disasters. USAID frequently deployed humanitarian teams to the region, including six Disaster Assistance Response Teams DARTs . USAID deployed DARTs to Haiti in response to a cholera outbreak in FY 2011 and Hurricane Matthew in FY 2017 to Mexico following a major earthquake in FY 2017 to The Bahamas and across the Caribbean in response to hurricanes Irma and Maria in FY 2017 and to the Bahamas following Hurricane Dorian in FY 2019. USAID also activated multiple Washington, D.C. based Response Management Teams RMTs to support coordination and response efforts in affected countries. Additionally, since FY 2018, USAID has maintained a DART and RMT to support the humanitarian response to the Venezuela regional crisis.","['Drought', 'Earthquake', 'Epidemic', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Tropical Cyclone', 'Volcano', 'Wild Fire']"
" iframe width 560 height 315 src https www.youtube.com embed 8G933DrfBLE frameborder 0 allowfullscreen iframe As severe winter weather makes living conditions for Syrian refugees even more difficult, health workers in Lebanon mobilize to provide critical assistance. BEKAA VALLEY, Lebanon, 17 February 2015 – Removing her shoe, a Syrian woman dangles her foot over a small fire while her husband crouches and rubs his hands together. Nearby, clothes on a laundry line sway in the freezing wind, barely drying. In this settlement of makeshift shelters in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, Syrian refugees are trying to cope with the bitter winter. Over the last month, snowstorms, hurling winds, rains and flooding have forced already vulnerable people to fight for survival. Infants and young children exposed to the climate and treacherous living conditions are especially susceptible to respiratory infections, flu, fever and diarrhea. Living in a tent at 900 metres altitude here in eastern Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, Awash, mother of four young children, is trying to keep her children safe from the cold. “My children got sick, and we took them to the medical unit,” she says. “We don’t have money to take them to the hospital. Thank God the medical unit is good.” Syrian refugees in informal settlements have limited access to public health care centres, which for many are too far away and too expensive to reach. To address this challenge, UNICEF has funded 21 mobile medical units to provide refugees free access to primary health care. The roaming medical units, supported by UNICEF and operated by local NGO Beyond Association, are set up in tents in each settlement and are staffed by personnel from the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health, including a doctor, two nurses, a midwife and a vaccinator. An acute emergency The medical units have been operating for two years in Lebanon in response to the influx of Syrian refugees, now numbering more than 1.1 million registered. With the recent severe weather, however, including Storm Zina in early January, one of the worst winter storms in decades, efforts have been intensified to reach refugee communities with critical medical assistance. “After the snow, and due to the storm, we are in an emergency,” says Dr. Zein El Din Saad from the Ministry of Public Health. “We were asked to go on the ground and help all the Syrian refugees.” On just a single day, Dr. El Din Saad sees 95 patients in one tented settlement. Most of them are infants, children and mothers with upper respiratory tract infections. Emergency health teams In addition to the mobile units, emergency health teams consisting of a doctor and nurse have also been mobilized to make home visits. Carrying a bucket full of medications, a nurse assists a female doctor going from one tent to the next, tending to patients. Because they are women, they are more easily welcomed into the tents, and there is less need to set up a separate medical station to receive people. “Patients have respiratory infections, bronchitis, tonsillitis and diarrhea,” says Dr. Fatima Moussawi from the Ministry of Public Health. “For that reason, our presence has been essential to avoid further complications.” Difficult access Despite the challenges accessing locations, the health workers see the impact of their efforts. “When the storm Zina started, it was very difficult to get to the settlements,” says Dr. Moussawi. “It was snowing and there was no electricity. Puddles of water could be seen inside and outside the tents. “The most important thing is that we arrived to the settlements at the right time,” she says.",['Cold Wave']
"OVERVIEW The East Asia and Pacific EAP region comprises 32 countries, with varying climates, levels of development and capacity, and vulnerabilities to hazards. The region experiences seasonal periods of increased hydrometeorological activity through cyclones, typhoons, and monsoon rains, which can result in significant damage and increase the risk of floods and landslides. Many EAP countries situated along the Pacific Ring of Fire experience seismic risks from earthquakes and associated tsunamis, as well as volcanic activity that occasionally can prompt wide scale evacuations. As in previous years, in FY 2012, USAID’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance USAID OFDA responded to these disasters and funded disaster risk reduction DRR programs to build the capacity of communities to prepare for and respond to emergencies. Following the creation of EAP as a separate and distinct USAID OFDA region in FY 2009, USAID OFDA has focused DRR activities in the region on strategic, context specific programs designed to meet particular risk reduction needs in each country, with capacity building as a consistent theme throughout all programs. In FY 2012, USAID OFDA continued scaling up implementation of this strategic approach through a number of new initiatives, while maintaining several regional programs that complement country specific activities and align with the overall goal to build region wide capacity. During FY 2012, USAID OFDA provided more than 23 million for DRR projects throughout EAP, including programs that integrate DRR with disaster response.","['Earthquake', 'Flood', 'Tsunami', 'Volcano']"
"Port Vila, 20 April 2015 – Thousands of children affected by Cyclone Pam in Vanuatu will receive new birth certificates through a national campaign launched this month by UNICEF and the Government of Vanuatu via the Ministries of Justice, Internal Affairs and Youth and Sports. The campaign, which will target 7000 children on 15 islands in six provinces, will promote birth registration for children whose births have not been registered, and re issue certificates for children whose legal documents were destroyed when Cyclone Pam stuck Vanuatu four weeks ago. An estimated 500 children are expected to have their births registered for the first time during this campaign while close to 6,500 children will be re issued with new certificates. “Birth registration is an official recording of a child as a citizen by a Government. It is both a right and an important process for child protection. Without a birth certificate, children, especially the most vulnerable, may one day find it difficult to access essential health and social services, and will find it difficult later on in life to apply for a job, get a passport, vote or open a bank account,” UNCEF Pacific Representative, Dr. Karen Allen said. “We have been working with Government to ensure that children in Vanuatu have their births registered, helping the Government to plan and allocate resources for children, and also ensure that children at a disadvantage will be included in national level planning and decisions this may be the first time in which re issue of lost birth certificates is part of post disaster early recovery in the Pacific,” Dr. Allen added. The campaign will begin on Monday 20 April, on the islands of Tanna, Tongoa, the Shepherd island group and Epi in Tafea and Shefa Provinces. Mobile registration teams equipped with a laptop, printer, generator and laminator will facilitate new birth registrations and re issue certificates on the spot in these locations. Erromango Tafea Province , Efate Shefa Province and Malampa and Penama Provinces will roll out their campaigns over May and July. UNICEF is also working with the Vanuatu Football Federation through the Just Play programme to support the birth registration campaign by holding two day sports festivals in targeted locations to reach around 20,000 people with information about the importance of birth registration and other emergency related issues. These will be also be supported by SMS texts promoting the campaign, which will be sent to communities in coming weeks. Vanuatu has made steady progress in birth registration rates in recent years. Between 2013 and 2014, birth registration rates for children under one year increased significantly from 40 to 60 per cent. UNICEF is appealing to communities to take advantage of the new campaign, ensuring that this momentum is not lost. “If children are not officially registered as citizens, they will be vulnerable to exclusion, including remaining uncounted in planning and budgeting. This has lasting consequences not only for their wellbeing but also for the development of their communities and countries,” Dr. Allen said. About UNICEF UNICEF promotes the rights and wellbeing of every child, in everything we do. Together with our partners, we work in 190 countries and territories to translate that commitment into practical action, focusing special effort on reaching the most vulnerable and excluded children, to the benefit of all children, everywhere.

" Malene Kamp Jensen Drought followed by flooding is becoming a vicious cycle “The water came quickly, taking one village after another,” said 30 year old Nyaroun, holding her one year old daughter, Nyajal, close to her chest at a UNICEF supported hospital in Bentiu, South Sudan. The little girl was brought here when her tummy started swelling weeks after floodwaters kept rising taking their food, cattle and home in the process. They are one of tens of thousands of families who have fled villages swallowed by an ever rising White Nile river, drowning cultivated land, livestock and belongings of already struggling communities in Unity State in South Sudan, an area long impacted by conflict and drought. Now, in addition to COVID 19, the flooding has added another layer of human misery and a crisis on top of crises. The flooding a third year in a row for the state but a first of this kind for Bentiu and Rubkona has caused massive displacement. The number of internally displaced due to conflict in the areas around Bentiu and Rubkona alone has already grown from around 90,000 people to some 120,000 while the latest human wave pushed here by flood water is about 46,000. People are surrounded by hip high flooding in the shallow parts, fenced in by make shift dykes created with the support of United Nations Peacekeepers. But unlike other floods from radical weather around the world, the water near Bentiu has been here since February, and is expected to stay for months longer as the once bone dry ground is fully saturated. With dead animals and washed out latrines in the mix, the water provides the perfect breeding ground for water borne diseases and mosquitos that carry malaria. Children swim in it to get relief from the scorching heat during the day. And adults women in particular venture in to get wood from what was once their homes to patch together new ones on dry land. They have little choice. Trees are under water, making even firewood for cooking difficult to come by. Add to the misery, snakebites are becoming more frequent as they too are seeking higher grounds. Food and other essentials, however, are becoming scarce. Roads that provided the main supply and trade route to the capital, Juba, or Khartoum in Sudan have been washed away driving the availability of goods down and prices up. It is taking a toll on the population. With many of the men bringing cattle to higher grounds and in search of food for their animals, women and children make up the majority in this area. And many, especially children, are getting sick. “The health situation is very bad,” said Dr. Duol Biem, Director General, Ministry of Health, Unity State. “We’re seeing more acute watery diarrhea, respiratory infections and malaria, and malnutrition has worsened,” he said. “And the water is still coming with all of these towns under threat. I have never seen that in my life.” UNICEF is working with the government and local officials, as well as donors and partners to provide support to children and their families. “This includes safe drinking water, sanitation, life saving vaccinations, including against COVID 19 for adults, basic healthcare and nutrition for mothers and children, and treatment for babies and young children who have already become malnourished,” explained David Kidega, UNICEF Nutrition Officer based in Bentiu. The good news is that dykes are holding for now. But water is already seeping through in some spots, including the road in Rubkona that leads to the airstrip. The worry is that the floodwater will stay, and when the next heavy rains are expected in April or May, it will unleash additional water and lead to even more misery and illness. At Bentiu’s hospital, Dr. Diang Puch, 36, said that the flooding continues to bring in “more and more children,” many severely malnourished and with acute diarrhea. Little Nyajal is one of the lucky ones, Dr. Puch said. The little girl is responding to treatment and is recovering. But with unpredictable weather that many attributes to climate change, her mother Nyaroun is concerned about what the future might hold for Nyajal and her three older children. “When we were in our village we had food and cows,” said Nyaroun. “The problem is coming from the flooding.” UNICEF thanks our generous donors who have contributed against the 2021 Humanitarian Action for Children HAC appeal, such as the governments of Canada, Germany, Japan, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom, the United States through CDC and USAID and the European Union Humanitarian Aid ECHO . .","['Drought', 'Flood', 'Other']"
" The below article was originally published on Business Fights Poverty on 25 September 2020. By Karen Smith, Programme Coordinator, Connecting Business initiative There were myriad situations where COVID 19 was an additional layer on pre existing crises, ranging from natural hazards such as earthquakes and hurricanes to manmade crises such as the refugee crisis or conflict. How does such a “confluence of crises” affect businesses, communities, and entire economies? In the experience of the Connecting Business initiative CBi – a platform transforming the way the private sector engages before, during and after crises – these situations drive home the importance the national private sector, resilience and preparedness, as well as collective action and collaboration as a critical part of local response. What has also been reinforced during the pandemic is that investing in the preparedness and resilience of communities and micro, small and medium enterprises MSMEs as well as the private sector as a whole is an economic imperative. For example, a recent report https www.tr.undp.org content turkey en home presscenter pressreleases 2019 09 turkiye ekonomisi buyudukce depremin etkisi buyuyor.html by Business for Goals B4G in Turkey highlighted that the Marmara earthquake the country experienced 20 years ago claimed the lives of approximately 17,000 people and inflicted losses on more than 30,000 enterprises, causing economic damages of approximately USD 27 billion. An equivalent event today would likely cause larger losses still, a clear call to action to invest in the resilience of businesses of all sizes. Other surveys https www.connectingbusiness.org turkey covid 19 survey result by B4G on the impact of COVID 19 showed a significant impact on businesses and that Syrian owned businesses were more significantly affected by the pandemic, with 38 of them declaring a full stop of operations compared to 22 of other businesses in the country. Investing in community resilience and preparedness is essential for risk mitigation and effective disaster response. In Haiti, the Alliance pour la Gestion des Risques et la Continuité des Activités AGERCA network carried out campaigns built on information sharing through broad business networks, providing training around health and safety measures as well as distributing hygiene kits to contribute to community preparedness and mitigate risks. When Tropical Storm Laura hit, in an unfortunate example of a confluence of crises, AGERCA sent more than two million text messages and provided phone credit to the National Emergency Center to facilitate communications between departments. Now, preparedness interventions are combining COVID 19 information sharing and reminders about hurricane season. In Sri Lanka, the Asia Pacific Alliance for Disaster Management Sri Lanka A PAD SL network has taken a collective and collaborative approach, joining hands with HSBC Bank and other private sector partners to support government efforts by providing healthcare essentials and ration support to frontline workers, communities and the health sector. A PAD Japan joined Sri Lanka’s COVID 19 resistance efforts by offering solid support to the country in partnership with A PAD Sri Lanka, providing an array of healthcare essentials to the Disaster Management Center DMC . The importance of collective action was also highlighted by efforts led by the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation PDRF . As part of their activities during the pandemic, they collectively raised the equivalent of USD 30 million through Project Ugnayan https www.pdrf.org media newsroom project ugnayan beneficiaries reach over 7 6 million people in greater metro manila poor communities , to fund the distribution of grocery vouchers to 14.2 million people in the poor communities of the greater Manila area.

In Vanuatu, the COVID 19 lockdown led to a scarcity in humanitarian personnel and resources which coincided when https www.aljazeera.com news 2020 04 coronavirus lockdown hobbles vanuatu cyclone recovery effort 200430062145722.html Tropical Cyclone Harold struck. Working with private sector partners and in collaboration with NGOs and the United Nations UN and in support of the government, the Vanuatu Business Resilience Council VBRC assisted in supplying over 1,000 remote coastal households with 35 tonnes of food and non food items over an eight week period. This local multi stakeholder response was critical in mitigating the impact and damages caused by the cyclone. While the pandemic has been a difficult situation across borders, it has also brought to the forefront that challenging times can align agendas and priorities, generating political will from many actors to strengthen multi stakeholder collaboration. It has also created more space for the local private sector to engage and be active in disaster response and recovery. And as it turns out, having less resources is not always an impediment when passionate, dedicated individuals champion collective and collaborative cross sectoral action. If that describes you, what are you and your business doing to contribute to the resilience of the community or communities you are a part of? Have you found that COVID 19 also aligned agendas and priorities? If so, how?

"Children are taking action and speaking up on climate emergency as extreme weather events continue to pose threats on their right to survive, access education, and well being according to a survey conducted by Save the Children Philippines. The child rights organization marks the World Sustainability Day highlighting calls for a unified action and strengthening of public awareness to address the harsh impact of climate emergency. Save the Children has launched the RedAlertonClimate to inform the public about the climate emergency during the pandemic and provide a platform for children to speak up to change the future. According to the survey of 41 children and youth from Metro Manila, Eastern Visayas and the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region for Muslim Mindanao BARMM conducted from October 8 17, 2020, children said their well being is also affected by frequent flooding, droughts and heat waves which prevent them to do things that they used to do, including going to school. “I can’t play outside. Flooding and air pollution make me sick,” said one of the child respondents. “Children are speaking up. We have to listen and consider their perspectives in the actions and decisions that we do in preventing climate and environment catastrophe,” said Atty. Alberto Muyot, Chief Executive Officer of Save the Children Philippines. The child rights organization said the COVID 19 pandemic is exacerbating the situation of children and their families who were affected by the series of extreme weather events including Typhoon Quinta international name Molave which flattened farmlands, destroyed houses and public infrastructures in the Bicol region and nearby provinces in Luzon. Save the Children Philippines advocated the passage of Republic Act 10821 or the Children's Emergency Relief and Protection Act that directs national and local government agencies to implement and sustain comprehensive emergency program to protect children, pregnant and lactating mothers from disasters and emergencies. “The most vulnerable children are paying the price of climate crisis as they suffer from irreversible, life long, health and social impacts of missing school, and malnutrition, we have to listen and work to fulfill their right to live in a safer and sustainable world,” said Muyot.","['Drought', 'Epidemic', 'Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Land Slide']"

In 2022, the GAVI Vaccine Alliance contributed to UNICEF Mozambique’s humanitarian response for COVID 19 while the United Kingdom provided support for Tropical Storm Ana response activities. UNICEF expresses its sincere gratitude to GAVI and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office for their generous contributions. The needs in Mozambique are increasing as a result of a busy cyclone season with multiple storms in rapid succession. The 2022 HAC, focused principally on the conflict in the north, has a funding gap of 85 percent. Without sufficient funds, over 600,000 children will not receive timely support to respond to basic needs. UNICEF is relying on resources carried over from 2021 and has reallocated some regular resources to address urgent gaps. Situation Overview Humanitarian Needs In February, cyclone activity in the Indian ocean was active with the formation of four tropical systems, of which two—Dumako and Emnati—were classified as a tropical depression and cyclone respectively. Tropical Storm Dumako affected central Mozambique areas previously affected by Tropical Storm Ana in January. The Tropical Depression Dumako brought significant rains in a short period of time impacting over 23,730 people in Nampula, Zambézia, Tete, Sofala, and Manica Provinces. New displacement in Cabo Delgado continues. During the reporting period, the International Organization for Migration reported 222 movements involving 14,202 people which an average of 48 percent of the displaced people were children. The highest movement was reported in the first week of February when 5,120 people moved from Meluco District, arriving primarily in Pemba. At the end of the month, the second highest movement was observed with 4,342 people moving from Nangade to Mueda or other parts of Nangade Districts. These movements are related to reported security incidents. The Famine Early Warning System Network FEWSNET reported that households impacted by Tropical Storms Ana and Dumako are expected to improve food security outcomes assuming seeds are available for post flood production. In Cabo Delgado and parts of Niassa, conflict affected areas are expected to remain in the Crisis level IPC Phase 3 , with areas receiving regular humanitarian food assistance likely to remain at the Stressed level IPC Phase 2 . On 14 February 2022, a polio outbreak was confirmed in Mozambique, after two vaccine derived polio cases were reported in Nampula and Cabo Delgado Provinces. In neighbouring Malawi, a wild poliovirus case was also detected in February. As a result, the Minister of Health declared a National Public Health Emergency in Mozambique on 21 Feb 2022. UNICEF, the World Health Organization WHO , and the Government of Mozambique have intensified surveillance measures to improve detection of Acute Flaccid Paralysis and poliovirus and working to implement a synchronized outbreak response with regional officials. The Government is planning two supplementary immunization activities in all provinces which adjoin Malawi or where poliovirus cases have been reported. This includes the provinces of Niassa, Cabo Delgado, Nampula, Zambézia, Sofala, Manica and Tete. Regarding COVID 19, the health authorities reported 3,421 active cases as of 28 February of which nearly 95 per cent are in Maputo City. Since the onset of the COVID 19 immunization campaign, health authorities have vaccinated over 11 million people, reaching 72.5 per cent of their target. With the significant reduction of COVID 19 cases, the Government alleviated most restriction measures removing the curfew time, opening schools at all levels, and returning to normal working hours, among others.","['Epidemic', 'Tropical Cyclone']"
"CARE Australia has welcomed the Australian Government’s contribution of 9 million to help countries across the Pacific prepare for and respond to the worsening El Niño linked drought. In Papua New Guinea, almost 2.5 million people are dealing with potentially life threatening food shortages due to severe drought and frost. Effects are also being felt in Vanuatu, which is still recovering from the devastating impact of Cyclone Pam in March, one of the worst disasters in the country’s history. “In many communities, people are already facing severe food shortages and the situation is only likely to get worse in the coming months. This funding is extremely important and will help us provide essentials to families who are already struggling to make ends meet as the drought has devastated vital crops,” said Daniel McCall, country director of CARE in Papua New Guinea. But Mr McCall warned continued support will be required to help communities respond to the drought. “CARE welcomes this vital support from the Australian Government for our Pacific neighbours but more help will be needed. This is a crisis on our doorstep and we need to do everything we can to get help to those who need it now.” CARE Australia’s recent assessments in Papua New Guinea’s Eastern Highlands found •Many households are at risk of running out of food, with the majority having less than a month of food stocks left •Low crop yields mean there are no food surpluses and consequently no money to buy food or other essentials •Households are limiting the number of meals eaten per day and have resorted to eating unfamiliar “bush food” •Water levels are extremely low and women are walking up to two hours to collect water •Poor water quality is increasing the risk of waterborne diseases The current El Niño weather pattern is likely to become one of the strongest on record, affecting rain patterns and temperatures across the world for the rest of the year and into 2016. CARE has worked in Papua New Guinea since 1989, and responded to the last major El Niño emergency in 1997.

"She knows that help is not coming and the only way to keep body and soul together after three devastating typhoons is to beg for aid. For two weeks now, Annalyn Consulta, a 28 year old mother, has been spending the whole day standing at the roadside hoping that relief is in one of the many vehicles that pass by the highway. Together with more than 30 people, she leaves their community in Bariis village in Tiwi town, Albay province at dawn to reach the main road before they miss a potential relief distribution. Her upland village was among the hardest hit by Super Typhoon Rolly international name Goni after its second landfall in Tiwi town on November 1. Before Rolly destroyed their homes, Typhoon Molave, known in the country as Quinta, had already totally damaged their crops when it passed by their village on October 23. She said the situation further worsened after Typhoon Ulysses international name Vamco brought in more rains on November 11. Annalyn, however, said that since the onslaught of these successive typhoons, no relief assistance has reached our village yet. It was after the havoc of Rolly when we decided to go down to the main highway and ask for food from passers by and wait for a relief distribution, she told the assessment team of ACT member National Council of Churches in the Philippines NCCP https actalliance.org about members national council of churches in the philippines nccp . She can't say how far, in terms of distance, their village is from the highway but her drowsy eyes tell how hard and tiring the journey is. We have to pass through piles of huge rocks and walk on a rough terrain into the mountains for around 30 minutes just to get here, Annalyn explains. She said they begin the long walk at daybreak with an empty stomach, hoping to find fruits or anything fit to eat along the way. Once they reach the highway, Annalyn and the other upland villagers would wait for any blessing, which she said, doesn't come frequently. We persevere to go to the highway from the mountain every day because we know the government will distribute relief packs and things that we can use to rebuild our houses, she said. However, there is no guarantee that they will be included in any relief distribution that will come to the lowland communities in Bariis village. Annalyn told the NCCP team that many of the aid providers prioritize those who live here in the lowland and those whose houses were totally damaged by the typhoon. For most of the days, she and the other upland villagers would return to their homes empty handed. At the road where Annalyn and the other upland villagers wait for aid, a community of the indigenous people called Agta tabangnon resides. Like the upland villagers, members of the Agta tabangnon indigenous group rely on the emergency relief packs that the local government and the outsiders bring. Nanay Consolacion, a 72 year old member of the cultural minority, said the typhoons that came one after another have destroyed our crops that were the only source of our food and livelihood. The more than 1000 indigenous people in Tiwi town are mostly Abaca, coconut, and vegetable farmers. The typhoons destroyed more than 90 percent of their crops. We will have to wait for our crops to grow again. In the meantime, we have no other choice but to rely on aid and hope that this aid comes now when it is badly needed, she said. NCCP aims to address the most urgent and life saving needs of the most vulnerable communities in Albay province through its local church constituents.","['Epidemic', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Tropical Cyclone']"

" Highlights UNICEF supported over 30,000 people in areas affected by Cyclone Eloise. In response to the threat of COVID 19 in cyclone affected communities of Sofala and Manica Provinces, UNICEF provided hygiene kits, clean water, and 20,000 face masks. Scale up of the humanitarian response in Cabo Delgado and neighboring provinces continues UNICEF supported 100,000 people—both displaced and host communities. UNICEF has funding gap of 63 resulting in limitations in providing lifesaving and life sustaining services to vulnerable children and their families. Funding Overview and Partnerships UNICEF is appealing for USD 52.8 million to provide life saving services for women and children in Mozambique. In 2021, the Government of Japan and the Government of the United Kingdom have generously contributed nearly 1.8 million to UNICEF Mozambique’s humanitarian response. UNICEF expresses its sincere gratitude for the contributions received. The 2021 HAC, however, still has a funding gap of 63 . Details of UNICEF’s budget requirements can be found in Annex B below and includes significant needs for all of UNICEF Mozambique’s ongoing emergency programmes. Without the required funding, UNICEF will be unable to support nearly 700,000 children with access to basic services such as safe water, adequate sanitation, access to health and nutrition services, learning opportunities, or critical child protection support. Situation Overview Humanitarian Needs Cyclonic activity in the Mozambique channel between January and February 2021 was active with a tropical storm and two tropical cyclones, including Cyclone Eloise on 23 January which affected the mainly central and southern regions and Tropical Storm Guambe which caused high winds and rain before turning into a cyclone offshore. According to National Institute for Disaster Management and Risk Reduction INGD , Cyclone Eloise affected 441,686 people in five provinces, resulting in 11 deaths, over 30,000 people displaced and destruction of infrastructure including 79 health facilities, over 700 classrooms, as well as roads and houses. The hardest hit was Sofala Province with 366,630 people affected, seven deaths and over 70 per cent of the displaced who were hosted in temporary accommodation centers or resettlement sites. The situation in Cabo Delgado remains volatile and unpredictable. From January to February 2021, security incidents continued resulting in additional displacements in the country. As of the end of 2020, there were nearly 670,000 people displaced due to the conflict with the majority remaining in Cabo Delgado and estimated 66,844 living in hard to reach areas. Children represent approximately 45 per cent of the IDPs, with women and men representing 32 and 23 per cent. During the reporting period, provincial authorities confirmed a cholera outbreak in five districts of Cabo Delgado and one district in Nampula with 2,757 total cumulative cases and 15 deaths during the reporting period.

"Hurricane Matthew in Haiti ‘catastrophic’ says the director of Caritas Haiti after the massive storm made landfall. Hurricane Matthew is battering the Caribbean nation with high winds, heavy rains and storm surges. The government declared a state of red alert.Towns including Tiburon, Cayes, Jérémie, Miragoane and Jacmel are on its projected path. “The effect of the hurricane in the south of Haiti is catastrophic,” said Fr Jean Hervé François, director of Caritas Haiti. “There have been deaths from drowning and collapsed buildings. Some communities are under water. Many buildings are damaged. People have lost everything.” Caritas is helping families who’ve left their homes, working with government emergency teams who have opened over 200 hurricane shelters in the at risk areas. Caritas has food packages for people to take refuge in shelters in Cayes, a city of 70,000. In Jacmel, it is providing hot meals, water and hygiene products. An emergency team there is in contact with parishes. It has also been giving out blankets, bedding and toiletry kits. Fr Hervé says that the food they have is enough for four days. Caritas is assessing the situation in the affected areas. Communications are down in some areas which are also physically cut off by floods. US member Catholic Relief Services http www.crs.org media center crs responding hurricane matthew caribbean CRS staff in Les Cayes report flooding from heavy rains and trees knocked down by strong winds. “The infrastructure is not able to handle so much rain in low lying area around Les Cayes,” said Chris Bessey, CRS’ country representative based in Port au Prince. “We’ll have to wait and see how bad the damage is, but flooding is a big concern.” Before the storm hit, CRS engineers were dispatched to field offices in Les Cayes, Jeremie and Jacmel – cities in the southwest part of Haiti that are directly in its path – and are on stand by to assess structural damage and begin repairs. Jean Simon Ludger of CRS’ office in Les Cayes said, “What scares me is that there are many fragile areas where flash flooding and landslides can be a great problem. People are living in slums where houses are not well constructed and can easily be taken away by floods and landslides.” Caritas warns of an increased risk of cholera due to the heavy rains and lack of access of clean drinking water. Some cases of cholera are already present in the south of Haiti and at least one death has been reported. Government preparations for the hurricane included evacuation of at risk communties, awareness raising through radio, social networks and word of mouth, the removal of billboards that could be uprooted by high winds and the closure of schools. A number of people stayed home despite warnings. They only tried to seek shelter in more robust cement buildings once there were high winds and torrential rains.",['Tropical Cyclone']
" i By Ahmad Pathoni i p b LANGGAM, Indonesia, Oct 15 Reuters b Armed with buckets and a newly installed electric pump powered by a portable generator, Iwan Marwan and five others struggle to put out embers on a smouldering two hectare field in Indonesia's Sumatra island. p The men say they don't know who started the fire but they believe it was not intentionally lit. p quot I'm helping them put out the fire to prevent it from spreading to my family's plantation, quot says Marwan as he pours a bucket of water on a smoky ember. p quot We know it is illegal to use fires to open land. Maybe someone threw a cigarette butt. During a dry season like now peat land is easy to burn, quot the 32 year old tells Reuters. p Others in the field surrounded by palm oil plantations decline to answer most questions but one says the land belongs to a military officer who lives in the provincial capital Pekanbaru, a three hour drive away over a rough road. p quot The owner is taking a military course in Jakarta, quot says the man, who declines to give his name. p The Langgam blaze for which no one claims responsibility highlights the difficulty in tackling annual forest and brush fires on Sumatra and the Indonesian part of Borneo which produce thick smoke choking widespread areas of Southeast Asia. p Farmers in those regions traditionally use fires to convert land into plantations cheaply and it is unlikely the fire Marwan and the others tried to put out was accidental. p Smouldering swathes of forest land with blackened tree stubs dot the area, in Pelalawan region of Sumatra's Riau province. p Haze from the Sumatra and Borneo fires blanketed neighbouring Malaysia and Singapore in past weeks, sending air quality to unhealthy levels and disrupting flights and sea navigation. p quot Unless action is taken against the offenders, mainly large plantation and timber companies, we will continue to choke on haze in the coming years, quot Hapsoro, a forest campaigner for Greenpeace Southeast Asia. tells Reuters. p But Riau police chief Ito Sumardi says fires and haze have significantly decreased in Riau thanks to firm law enforcement. p Cheap slash and burn practices are a local custom difficult to eradicate but adoption of the method by large plantation companies had exacerbated the situation, he says. p quot Large plantation companies are taking advantage of an ancestral practice to open land cheaply and efficiently, quot Sumardi tells Reuters. p He says companies often pay locals to do the clearing and later evade responsibility for fires by claiming their land had been encroached upon. p Law enforcement has been hampered by lack of funds and difficulty in gathering evidence, he adds. p quot We are overwhelmed by detainees. Now we detain more land clearing suspects than other criminals, quot Sumardi says, adding that so far 70 people in Riau have been prosecuted on charges of starting fires. p One way to reduce slash and burn practices is by preventing burned land from being used pending a court verdict, he suggests. p But there were no signs that the smoking fields in Pelalawan had been impounded. p b FRUSTRATED NEIGHBOURS b p Indonesia's neighbours, particularly Singapore and Malaysia, are increasingly frustrated with Jakarta's failure to prevent or extinguish the annual dry season fires. p Environment ministers from the three countries as well as Thailand and Brunei gathered in Pekanbaru last Friday to discuss ways to end the crisis but failed to agree on a detailed plan. p A proposed special regional fund to deal with the haze could not be operational unless Indonesia ratified a 2002 Association of South East Asian Nations ASEAN haze treaty, ministers said. p Indonesia has pledged to ratify the pact but it is still being studied by parliament. p Jakarta has argued extreme weather and poverty severely limit the effectiveness of government efforts to curb the fires. Officials also say many fires are on peat land, resulting in thick smoke and making it harder to extinguish them. p Khairul Zainal, head of the environmental impact control agency in Riau, estimates the cost of the haze at 10 trillion rupiah 1.09 billion for affected Indonesian regions. p Not far from Langgam village, plantation worker Suyanto says the return of the haze this year has made him unhealthy. p quot I have just recovered from a cough. Now it looks like I'm sick again, quot he says while having lunch with his co workers in a wooden house in the middle of a palm oil plantation. p quot This morning it was very dark. I couldn't see far enough, quot he said.",['Wild Fire']
"Local actors are critical both as first responders in a crisis and the providers of long term support. Since the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016, work has continued through the Grand Bargain Localization Workstream and the IASC to deliver on commitments that reinforce complementarity of international response with ongoing nationally and locally led response at the country level. COVID 19 has instilled a renewed sense of urgency in the need to support local and national actors. Localization is regarded as a necessity and an opportunity to effectively meet humanitarian needs, especially where post COVID 19 response and recovery efforts are largely led by local organizations. This offers an important opportunity to gather evidence on the comparative advantages of local and national actors in local response. Over the last year, there has been progress in many areas Guidance to support local and national action in the COVID 19 response At a time when the effective and timely response to COVID 19 required immediate response at local and national levels and travel and movement restrictions impeded the international community’s response, the IASC released Interim Guidance on Localisation and the COVID 19 response https interagencystandingcommittee.org inter agency standing committee iasc interim guidance localisation and covid 19 response developed . This was produced in recognition of the critical role of national and local actors, including civil society organizations, the Red Cross Red Crescent Movement’s 14 million volunteers, Governments, the private sector, and communities themselves. The guidance highlights the importance of providing expertise, capacity and support to staff and partners already on the ground. It stresses how national and local actors can contribute to a complete response that reaches the most vulnerable people and addresses the gendered impact of the COVID 19 emergency. The guidance will require further operationalizing in 2021. Aid in action Somalia local NGOs work to flatten the curve In the spring of 2020, Somalia was affected by the triple threat of floods, locusts and COVID 19. In southern Somalia in particular, local NGOs played a critical role in the humanitarian response. Movement restrictions limited the access of UN organizations and INGOs to certain areas, meaning that only local organizations could mount a response. Local Somali NGOs distributed translations of key WHO public health messages and COVID 19 mitigation strategies, as well as myth busting misinformation about the virus. This demonstrated their ability to deliver life saving responses to flatten the curve of the pandemic. Local leadership and meaningful participation in coordination mechanisms Work has continued to increase the meaningful participation and leadership of local actors within humanitarian coordination. This includes disseminating best practices on ways to involve local actors e.g. the Handbook on Humanitarian Coordination and Collaboration in Bangladesh https www.humanitarianresponse.info en operations bangladesh document handbook humanitarian coordination and collaboration bangladesh including local and national NGOs in the strategic advisory groups of global clusters, such as the Global Education Cluster efforts to ensure the consistent translation of cluster and coordination guidance into local and national languages and a commitment to establish benchmarks to measure global https interagencystandingcommittee.org grand bargain official website guidance notes localisation may 2020 progress. Sustained efforts will be needed to further expand the active involvement of local and national NGOs in international and country level coordination mechanisms, with additional efforts required to include women’s organizations, and refugee and IDP led organizations. Aid in action Vanuatu local business network in action after cyclone Support from the local business network was critical in responding to Tropical Cyclone Harold in April 2020 in Vanuatu – the first country to respond to a natural disaster under pandemic related border closures. The Vanuatu Business Resilience Council VBRC is a member of the global Connecting Business initiative https www.connectingbusiness.org vanuatu , which is a multi stakeholder initiative jointly supported by OCHA and UNDP. VBRC activated its preparedness measures, including telecommunications teams, to reconnect the islands after the cyclone, and it provided shipping and logistics services to support relief and recovery efforts. VBRC also conducted an aerial, ground and marine assessment, and it worked closely with the UN and NGOs locally in support of the Government to supply over 35 tons of food and non food items to 1,000 remote coastal households. VBRC was among the first stakeholders to arrive and deliver aid to some parts of the island of Espiritu Santo. Since then, VBRC and Oxfam in Vanuatu have been working on an unblocked cash programme https connectingbusiness.us7.list manage.com track click?u d89a089eb32bd022ed2ededf6 id 9f4bef1a2b e 1f014f2157 to benefit vulnerable communities and support local businesses affected by the tropical cyclone and COVID 19. Over 190 local shops have been registered in the electronic cash payment system. More financing for local actors Pooled funds play a key role for donors seeking to meet their Grand Bargain localization commitments, and in supporting the commitment to channel 25 per cent of global humanitarian funding as directly as possible to local and national responders. Encouragingly, local and national NGOs recently had increased access to the UN’s pooled funds see Pooled funds and humanitarian emergencies https gho.unocha.org delivering better pooled funds and humanitarian emergencies , and they continue to access funds via NGO managed pooled funds, such as the START Network. Where there are no CBPFs, investment in alternative nationally driven solutions should be promoted, including direct financing to local and national NGOs and allowing indirect support costs to be subgranted to these organizations. Examples of good practice include The Start Fund Bangladesh , which demonstrated the importance of local actors as first responders due to their community ties. The fund contributed to halving the amount of time taken to disburse funds for community responses from 20 days to 10 from the moment an alert is raised. In 2020, the fund allocated 100 per cent of its funding dedicated to the COVID 19 response to local NGOs. The Women's Peace and Humanitarian Fund opened a COVID 19 funding window https wphfund.org covid19 for local civil society organizations with a fast track procedure for allocating funds to respond to gendered aspects of the pandemic, including GBV. The Network for Empowered Aid Response responded to real time community needs before, during and after a disaster through a pilot project in Nepal and Somalia, which disbursed funds using localized governance structures and systems. Aid in action Bangladesh rapid disbursements after confinement Start Fund Bangladesh made its first COVID 19 related allocation https medium.com start network the case for localisation amidst covid 19 818a76dfc140 on 27 March. This was one day after Bangladesh went into confinement and nine days after it reported its first death from the disease. The fund made its second allocation on 31 March. A total of 714,162 reached 4 million people from the most vulnerable communities across 23 districts. This increased vital access to facilities for protection against and treatment of COVID 19 and provided key health messages. .","['Epidemic', 'Tropical Cyclone']"

" Disaster Hits One of the Poorest Countries in the World Bonn Berlin, 15 08 2021 The southwest of Haiti was rocked by a severe earthquake yesterday. The tremors were stronger than during the devastating earthquake of 2010, in which 200,000 people lost their lives. Many buildings have been destroyed, and the number of dead and injured continues to rise. Welthungerhilfe is working with partner organizations to prepare the necessary assistance measures. “The earthquake has particularly affected the south and the province of Nippes. These are some of the poorest areas on the island, and they have poor infrastructure. The only road to the province from the capital Port au Prince runs through areas that have been controlled by armed groups since June. It is becoming a great challenge to supply the villages and devastated hospitals with aid supplies. Many people there have not just survived the last big earthquake, but also suffered the effects of Hurricane Matthew in 2016. This disaster has now once more destroyed their livelihoods , says Annalisa Lombardo, Country Director for Welthungerhilfe in Haiti, explaining the desperate situation faced by locals. The disaster hits the Caribbean country at a time when it is already facing political instability, economic woes, and great hardship. The President, Jovenel Moïse, was murdered a month ago. At the same time, Haiti is suffering greatly from the economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic, and the country still has hardly any access to vaccines. Welthungerhilfe is helping its partners from the European network Alliance2015 to provide assistance in the affected areas. Initial emergency assistance measures are already being prepared. This includes distribution of hygiene products such as soap. Food and water are also needed.

It has unique relief consisting of ridges, cliffs and bamboo forest, as well as low lying flat areas. It is therefore prone to both landslides and flooding. The forest cover on the mountainous part has been grossly depleted by human activity as the area has a generally fast growing population. The terrain in the southern part of the district is mountainous and is prone to flash flooding. The northern part of the district, closer to Nakapiripirit District, is drier and is prone to clean water shortages.","['Flood', 'Mud Slide']"
"Two children reportedly https www.bbc.com arabic middleeast 54191135 lost their lives during an attempt to cross from Lebanon to Cyprus last week. The flimsy dinghy is believed to have become stranded on the Mediterranean Sea for several days, causing the young children, one boy aged two and the other age not confirmed to die from heat, hunger and thirst. Save the Children is deeply concerned at this tragic report, which is the latest in a surge of Lebanese and Syrian families making desperate attempts to escape increasingly harsh conditions in Lebanon. Over the past few weeks, a growing number of families have attempted the perilous route from Tripoli to Cape Greco.

The pain and suffering this family would have endured to drive them to this only to culminate in such a tragic end is truly unimaginable. Two children have paid with their lives for the miserable conditions that thousands of families in Lebanon continue to experience. “The Beirut Port explosion has added to the daily suffering of vulnerable families struggling already with an unprecedented economic and COVID 19 crises. People have lost their homes and jobs just as the cost of living soared, making them lose hope in this country. A lot of families are homeless and hungry and don’t know how they will feed their children. Among the most vulnerable families across the country many are feeling they have no choice but to take to the sea with the hope that it is going to be better on the other side.” “We appeal to the caretaker Lebanese government to address the urgent needs of children living in poverty, and to provide vulnerable families with much needed support. We are also calling on Cypriot authorities to put the interest of children first, and to address the needs of those who make it to Cypriot shores.

"HAVANA – CARE’s team in Cuba is on alert as Hurricane Matthew heads north after battering vulnerable communities in Haiti. The Category 4 Hurricane is expected to hit the eastern provinces of Cuba late Tuesday into early Wednesday morning. CARE has been in contact with local Cuban authorities to potentially provide support if needed. “While the Cuban government has done a good job preparing for Matthew, this is an extremely powerful hurricane,” says Richard Paterson, country representative for CARE in Cuba. “Affected communities will need food, water and shelter support. We know many homes and buildings are vulnerable to high winds, especially in the rural areas, particularly those with older and weaker roofs. ” Cuban residents have been busy preparing for the upcoming storm, boarding up homes and storefronts and Cuban Civil Defense has been pruning tree limbs to avoid hitting electricity lines. Cuban authorities have also evacuated residents from particularly vulnerable coastal areas. CARE’s team in the eastern provinces report that the scene is relatively calm in advance of Matthew, but people are anxious, remembering Hurricane Sandy from 2012, which hit the same region. CARE has been active in Cuba for more than two decades with programming focused on food, water and sanitation, disaster risk reduction, humanitarian assistance, and gender equality. CARE is familiar with the emergency needs of provinces facing Hurricane Matthew, having worked in these communities through local partners following Hurricane Sandy. Hurricane Matthew made landfall in Haiti this morning pounding communities with winds exceeding 230 km h and heavy rainfall. CARE’s team on the ground in the affected region reported flooding and fear the impact of rainfall exceeding one metre could have on local water supplies.

More detailed information is provided in the 2008 2009 Programme Support Plan and Summary Matrix . p i In a world of global challenges, continued poverty, inequity, and increasing vulnerability to disasters and disease, the International Federation with its global network, works to accomplish its Global Agenda, partnering with local community and civil society to prevent and alleviate human suffering from disasters, diseases and public health emergencies. i p b Current context b p The People's Republic of China, with a population of 1.3 billion people, is by far the most populous country in the world, and has both one of the most dynamic and fastest growing economies, while at the same time very marked disparities in income distribution, health status and other vulnerability indicators. While the country invests in preparations for the 2008 Olympics, the people continue to face economic and health challenges that threaten their well being. Extreme poverty, however, remains an ever present reality in some parts of the country, regardless of the country's rapid economic progress. p One of the main causes of this continuing significant level of poverty is the effect of large scale, natural disasters, such as the annual occurrence of severe widespread flooding and frequent earthquakes in many parts of the country. Over the past years, China has seen an increase in the frequency of natural disasters caused by intensified severe weather patterns in the region. And those in the past two years have been some of the worst in recorded history. p At the same time, China faces a growing threat from the spread of infectious disease, such as HIV AIDS and avian influenza. Since 1999, there has been a 30 percent annual rate of increase of reported HIV infections. Based on this calculation, it is projected that without enough effort to control the epidemic, the number of people living with HIV AIDS in China will exceed ten million by 2010. p The Red Cross Society of China RCSC plays an important role as an auxiliary to the government at all levels in addressing the needs of vulnerable populations.

" Hong Kong, 28 May 2021 A magnitude 7.4 earthquake hit the Qinghai Province, China on last Saturday 22 May . As of 25 May, 18 injuries have been reported, and over 23,000 affected people have been evacuated to temporary relocation sites in the eight most affected counties. The earthquake tore up infrastructures and bridges, with one collapsing completely. According to preliminary needs assessment, the affected people who currently live in tents at the temporary relocation sites need folding beds, household items, and clothes to stay warm under the cold weather in Qinghai. Thousands of displaced people are waiting to return homes. For example, students have to live in tents set up on the playground because their dormitories were destroyed in the earthquake. Therefore it is crucial to create a safe and dignified living environment for the affected communities during this period. HKRC Actions After the earthquake, the HKRC immediately contacted the local Red Cross to understand the situation. In response to the humanitarian needs brought by the earthquake, the HKRC mobilized 2,000 prepositioned family kits and 3,334 folding beds a total of approximately HKD 1.71 million to the Qinghai Provincial Red Cross to support the displaced people in affected areas. The first round of distribution was completed at one of the relocation sites in the most affected Madou county 瑪多縣 on 27 May 2021. We are also in close communications with the local Red Cross for relief material distribution and further assessment of humanitarian needs. Actions by Red Cross Society of China In response to the earthquake, the Qinghai provincial Red Cross deployed a relief working team to conduct a need assessment and support the relief operation in the affected area.

" FAO expects desert locust infestations to persist across Ethiopia and Somalia through at least March 2021. Yemen remains a reservoir for desert locust breeding, posing a continued threat to the Horn of Africa region. Widespread breeding in Red Sea coastal areas of Eritrea and Sudan will substantially increase infestations in Eritrea in particular. Since January, control operations have prevented 1.5 million MT of crop loss at harvest time, safeguarding the food security of 9.9 million people and protecting grazing areas for the livestock of 687,000 households. KEY DEVELOPMENTS Rains Support September Desert Locust Breeding in Much of East Africa Desert locust infestations continue to threaten food security and livelihoods in northeastern Ethiopia and northern Somalia, where heavy rains have intensified breeding in recent weeks, causing increased bands of hoppers—immature, wingless locusts—and immature swarms to form, FAO reports. Similarly, unusually heavy rainfall has contributed to widespread breeding in Red Sea coastal areas of Eritrea and Sudan, with FAO expecting infestations in Eritrea to increase substantially in October. Despite above average rainfall in most East African countries in recent months, below average rains are forecast for much of the Horn of Africa region between October and December, possibly reducing vegetation availability for locusts and limiting new swarm formation, according to the Intergovernmental Authority on Development IGAD ’s Climate Predictions and Applications Center. However, FAO and IGAD expect desert locust infestations to continue threatening crop production and pasture regeneration significantly in most affected areas of Ethiopia and Somalia through at least March 2021. Additionally, immature swarms in northeastern Ethiopia and northern Somalia—possibly supplemented by additional swarms from Yemen—will likely begin moving south toward Kenya as regional winds shift in October. Swarms are likely to migrate to Ethiopia’s Ogaden Desert and central Somalia in the coming weeks, potentially reaching northern Kenya—where only a few residual swarms remained as of September 30—by late October continued surveillance will remain critical for detecting additional breeding and containing any new infestations in the coming months.","['Epidemic', 'Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Insect Infestation']"
" Background On the evening of Sunday 27 January 2019, strong winds and torrential rainfall battered parts of Cuba, including the capital city of Havana. Amid the stormy weather, a powerful tornado ripped through parts of the city causing significant damage. The severe weather has been blamed for at least eight deaths while more than 190 others have been hospitalized with varying injuries, according to Reuters. The tornado was classified as an F 3 by the Cuban Center for Meteorology, with estimated winds of 155 199 mph. The tornado is the strongest to strike Cuba in nearly 80 years, since a Category F4 tornado struck the town of Bejucal in December 1940. Other reports from the city indicated that cars were overturned, trees were uprooted, and homes were damaged by the severe weather. As of Monday afternoon, around 500,000 people were still without power and 200,000 were without water as emergency crews continued repairs following the storm. Damage to Hijas de Galicia Maternity Hospital forced patients and staff to evacuate shortly after the storm on Sunday night. Six people were reported dead and 195 injured, with 1,238 houses affected. 11 health institutions and 46 schools were damaged and 21 day care centers were affected. The electricity and phone services were destroyed. The government , faith based organizations and the population in general are working in the recovery process, and providing sanitation and rehabilitation of basic services such as electricity and water and sanitation. The government is providing food rations to the affected population. Cuban Minister of Foreign Trade and Investment have reports that donations from outside the island for storm victims can be made by national or regional governments, companies, NGOs, or individuals through the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Investment to ensure that relevant tax and tariffs exemptions are applied and that donations are distributed to those in need. The Venezuelan government sent 100 tons of humanitarian aid, containing building materials and equipment. Humanitarian Needs The tornado has critically disturbed the life in the affected areas, where the impacts are more severe for affected people with special needs including people living with disabilities, elderly and children who require additional support to access assistance. According to data collected by the government authorities there are severe damages to houses and other infrastructure, the affected households have lost their basic household items, including water containers. Water distribution systems are also affected. Lastly, due to deterioration of residual water and excreta management systems, the affected population is at risk to water and vector borne disease. Elderly, children and women are among the most vulnerable persons affected who show signs of post disaster distress. The most pressing needs are housing and public infrastructure repairments, WASH, Food security, non food items and psychosocial support.",['Severe Local Storm']
" COVID 19 pandemic has further exacerbated hardships and discrimination faced by people in Ukraine, says UN Human Rights A new UN report shows how the COVID 19 pandemic and response measures aggravated human rights concerns in Ukraine, particularly for those who already faced discrimination and exclusion before the pandemic. Paying particular attention to the impact on economic and social rights, the report highlights how the pandemic has affected the rights of groups in vulnerable situations. It covers the period from 20 February 2020 to 6 December 2020 and is based on the work of the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine HRMMU . “The closure of entry exit crossing points in eastern Ukraine has resulted in the separation of families, and the loss of already limited access to healthcare, education, pensions and sources of income for people living there”, said Matilda Bogner, Head of the HRMMU. The monthly average number of crossings through the contact line in eastern Ukraine decreased from 1.1 million in 2019, to less than three hundred as a consequence of the closure of all five entry exit crossing points from late March to late June 2020. Although crossings of the contact line have increased since June, their levels remain low, especially in Donetsk region, due to restrictions. In relation to the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, Ukraine, temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation Crimea , the report highlights that restrictions on freedom of movement introduced by the Governments of Ukraine and the Russian Federation have also significantly affected people’s access to work, education, healthcare, property and family links. “While some of the restrictions might be necessary to prevent the spread of the virus, where persons need to cross on humanitarian grounds, all parties must ensure that freedom of movement is respected, and that crossings of the contact line and ABL are quick, safe and dignified,” said Bogner. The report also states that people in detention are particularly vulnerable to COVID 19, as some detention facilities are overcrowded and cannot fully comply with prevention measures such as physical distancing. In Government controlled territory, the number of cases amongst penitentiary staff grew rapidly in October and November, increasing the risk of infection among detainees and prisoners. While no reliable figures regarding COVID 19 cases in detention are available in territory controlled by self proclaimed ‘Donetsk people’s republic’, self proclaimed ‘Luhansk people’s republic’ and in Crimea, persons in detention there reportedly lacked personal protective equipment and access to adequate healthcare. Access to justice and the right to a public trial were also affected by COVID 19 related restrictions, with some courts prohibiting observers and journalists access to their premises. The report also highlights incidents of hate speech and discriminatory acts towards different groups, including persons potentially infected by the COVID 19, LGBTI, Roma, homeless persons and healthcare workers, as a direct or indirect consequence of the pandemic. It further documented the involvement of public authorities in hate speech incidents, in clear breach of their human rights obligations. The report highlights the COVID 19 impact on frontline healthcare workers who must deal with heavy workloads while facing issues such as the lack of healthy and safe working conditions, fair remuneration and mental health support services. “Conditions of work of all healthcare workers must be improved. Female and male healthcare workers need to receive decent pay, safe and healthy conditions of work, and compensation for work related illnesses and injuries, including for COVID 19,” Bogner added. The report emphasizes that response measures should ensure that no one is left behind, particularly those from vulnerable groups who were already facing discrimination. “People in vulnerable situations, like Roma, persons with disabilities, older persons and persons living in homelessness, and particularly women and girls within these groups, faced even more limited enjoyment of the rights to health, work, education and an adequate standard of living since the outbreak of the COVID 19 pandemic”, she said. It concludes with targeted recommendations, both short term and long term, to the Government and other actors to remove existing barriers and combat discrimination. The Government should also consult representatives of groups at risk and civil society while designing and implementing COVID 19 responses and socio economic recovery measures. “We know that further human rights concerns are expected to emerge, as the number of infections in Ukraine continues to rise and the impact of the pandemic is constantly evolving. Placing human rights up front and centre provides a roadmap to ensure we leave no one behind and recover better, creating a more resilient society”, Bogner concluded.",['Epidemic']

"HIGHLIGHTS p b Regional b Malawi, Zambia and Tanzania continue to supply maize to grain deficit countries. However, regional surpluses are not enough to cover these deficits in the different countries. Limited market and transport infrastructure is hampering the distribution of grain from surplus to deficit areas, thereby resulting in high prices. Cases of cholera and other communicable diseases as in the case of Angola and Lesotho continue to expose the fragility of the regions health infrastructure. Ahead of the rainy season, several countries in the region are undertaking Contingency Planning. p b Mozambique b Approximately, 520,000 people are in need of emergency food assistance in the drought affected southern and central areas.

Protection, health, water and sanitation components of the appeal remain unfunded. p b Lesotho b The US 18.9 million drought flash appeal is 48.5 percent funded. To date, no funds have been committed for the child protection and early recovery components of the fund. p b Namibia b The resettlement of flood affected people in Caprivi was completed in September 2007. According to the Directorate of Disaster Management DDM , of the 6,000 flood affected people, approximately 3,000 people were relocated with support from the Government, while others' voluntarily relocated themselves back to their villages. The government together with the Namibia Red Cross provided tarpaulin, poles, and plastics for the construction of temporary dwellings. The DDM, along with the Caprivi Regional Council will be providing food assistance for the months of October and November to the flood victims in Caprivi. p b Zambia b In the flood affected areas, an estimated 440,866 people will require food assistance estimated at 31,742 tonnes, from September to February, 2008. Maize exports are limited to 200 000 MT and therefore prices are expected to remain low for the remainder of the season. p b Angola b Eighty nine cases of cholera were reported between 24 and 30 September, resulting in one fatality. A total of 16,731 cases of cholera were reported from January to end September, resulting in 435 fatalities. In 2006, a cholera outbreak that began in mid February and showed signs of abating in June, resurfaced in November claiming the lives of 2,584 people and infecting 63,200 people. p b Madagascar b Results were released this month from the Emergency Food Security Assessment EFSA that was conducted during May and June for the North West Diana and Sofia regions and South East Atsimo Atsinana and Vatovavy Fitovinany regions. The main assessment findings indicated that moderate to severe food insecurity was the highest at 66 percent in the inaccessible north western parts, followed by 53 percent in the south eastern parts. p b Malawi b Results from a nutrition assessment that was conducted in June in Karonga, Ntchisi, Chikwawa and Nsanje districts were released this month. The findings from the assessment showed prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition GAM among children 6 59 months of age at 1.3 in parts of Karonga District, 0.6 in Ntchisi District, and 2.7 in the Chikwawa Nsanje districts. To address this situation, nutrition supplies for a period of two months were delivered in September 2007 to all 95 Nutrition Rehabilitation Units.",['Fire']
"SC 14422 The sweeping and devastating effects of the COVID 19 pandemic are continuing to grow, and so too are the risks of instability and tension amidst glaring inequalities in the global recovery, senior United Nations officials warned today during a Security Council videoconference on the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on international peace and security. The meeting focused on the implementation of resolution 2532 2020 , adopted on 1 July 2020, in which the Council expressed its support for the Secretary General’s appeal, made 100 days earlier, for a global ceasefire to help unite efforts to fight COVID 19 in the world’s most vulnerable countries. Through that text, the 15 member organ also called for an immediate 90 day humanitarian pause to enable the safe, unhindered and sustained delivery of life saving assistance. Rosemary DiCarlo, Under Secretary General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, said that the pandemic’s impact on peace and security has intensified — exacerbating inequality and corruption breeding misinformation, stigmatization and hate speech and creating new flashpoints for tension and increased risks of instability. It is hindering diplomatic action and complicated peacemaking efforts, without for the most part affecting the underlying dynamics of armed conflicts. The impact on women, youth and other marginalized groups is particularly alarming, she said. In some instances, the Secretary General’s call for a global cessation of hostilities has given new momentum to faltering peace processes, she said, pointing to ceasefires in Libya and Ukraine, ongoing Afghanistan peace negotiations and the start of a disarmament process among insurgent groups in Mozambique. Other places, however, have witnessed a dangerous escalation of tension, including large scale fighting in Nagorno Karabakh. Without exception, United Nations missions and the Secretary General’s special representatives and special envoys have adjusted to the changing reality, embracing new tools such as digital focus groups. At the same time, since the onset of the pandemic, the United Nations has supported 19 elections and one referendum in 18 countries. Looking ahead, she warned that as the pandemic’s impact grows, so too will the risk of tensions and instability, magnified by inequalities in the global recovery. As rich countries get vaccinated, the developing world — including countries already trapped in conflict and instability — risks being left behind, dealing a severe blow to peace and security. “One thing is clear The pandemic has served as a political stress test as much as a structural and public health one,” she said. It has laid how acute crisis can become an opportunity to gain advantage on the battlefield or as a pretext to perpetuate oppression — but it has also confirmed that almost no barrier is insurmountable when there is real political will, supported by the global community, to make and sustain peace. Going forward, the collective and individual engagement of Council members will remain crucial, she said, adding that “recovering better” in the wake of the pandemic will require more political and financial investment in conflict prevention. Jean Pierre Lacroix, Under Secretary General for Peace Operations, said that already complex political situations continued to feel the strain of the virus. In South Sudan, for example, the pandemic has further delayed the implementation of the peace process. In Lebanon, it has exacerbated a difficult political situation. In Central African Republic, some political actors tried to leverage the pandemic as a pretext to delay elections and establish an unconstitutional transition. Against that backdrop, however, the crisis has put a spotlight on the importance of women’s leadership to mitigate political risks. Notwithstanding these challenges, United Nations peacekeeping missions continue to deliver on their mandated tasks, demonstrating adaptability, resilience and innovation, he said, noting however that pandemic related restrictions are presenting challenges for the ongoing drawdown of African Union United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur UNAMID . While adapting to challenges, peacekeeping operations are emphasizing the health and safety of their military, police and civilian personnel, he said, with preventative measures including physical distancing, travel restrictions, telecommuting and rotations of in office staff. As of today, across all field missions, and of more than 100,000 personnel, there have been 2,486 cumulative cases of COVID 19 among United Nations personnel and dependents and, unfortunately, 24 fatalities. Seventy seven per cent of rotations of uniformed personnel scheduled for the second half of 2020 were completed and only 2 per cent postponed, he said, adding that COVID 19 pre deployment awareness training has been introduced. He went on to say that since the pandemic began, peacekeeping operations have consistently endeavoured to support host country authorities to contain the spread of the virus. Citing examples, he said that the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali MINUSMA , United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic MINUSCA , United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo MONUSCO and United Nations Mission in the Republic of South Sudan UNMISS have used their respective radio stations to uphold facts and raise public awareness. Police contingents are meanwhile supporting national police services to combat the spread of COVID 19. Going forward, peacekeeping operations are working to anticipate changing risks through long term horizon scanning, with a view to better prepare for them, while also drawing lessons to foster good practices, he said. Atul Khare, Under Secretary General for Operational Support, said that the Department of Operational Support has activated its supply chains to support field missions, procuring and distributing over 4 million in personal protective and intensive care unit equipment, along with 35 testing machines, and 150,000 antibody test kits. Medical facilities in Juba and Goma were upgraded, adding over 30 medical staff, and creating polymerase chain reaction PCR testing and intensive care unit capacities. Public heath colleagues have provided guidance and training materials. The Department conducted virtual walk throughs in 22 duty stations, 43 contingents living arrangements, and 83 clinics and hospitals across 11 missions. The Field Remote Infrastructure Management technology platform uses sensors to remotely manage field mission engineering and facilities infrastructure, overall reducing the exposure to COVID 19. The MEDEVAC Task Force, led by the Department, has now conducted 140 medical evacuations as part of an inter agency and system wide effort. Regional hubs have been established in Nairobi, Accra, Costa Rica, and Kuwait with the facilities in Nairobi and Accra now receiving the largest number of Medevacs. “The mechanism has been a success and has given our personnel and partners the confidence to stay and deliver in some of the United Nations most difficult duty stations around the world,” he underscored. The rotation policy, he added, has allowed for the quick detection of cases and the ability to isolate and replace personnel without delay. Pre deployment cases have been detected among uniformed personnel before their arrival. The new long term air charter agreements introduced in July 2020 were designed to reduce troop movement costs by 15.5 per cent, he said, noting that since the resumption of the rotations savings have been significant. The Department is working with other partners, including the African Union and the European Union, to prevent and mitigate the spread of COVID 19 in various operational contexts and exchange lessons learnt. The Secretary General has tasked the Department to coordinate a system wide vaccination effort for all United Nations personnel and dependents world wide, he said, adding that they positively responded to the Secretary General’s call for host countries to include United Nations personnel in their national roll out programmes. Thanking Israel for becoming the first country to have provided the first doses to seven peacekeepers in Camp Ziouani, he said that in cases where vaccine delivery will not be possible through the host country, the Department will identify alternate arrangements. A “Group of Friends” of troop and police contributing countries has been convened to agree upon a pragmatic, coherent and common approach to vaccinate personnel. Mark Lowcock, Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, focused on the humanitarian crisis, recalling that 10 days ago, the world passed the grim milestone of 2 million deaths from COVID 19. Of the almost 98 million people confirmed to have contracted the virus across the world, 24 million — almost one quarter — live in countries facing humanitarian or refugee crises. “That’s the tip of the iceberg,” he said, adding that most cases are still not reflected in the figures. The secondary consequences of the virus are even more lethal. In 2021, an estimated 235 million people will need humanitarian assistance and protection, up 40 per cent from 2020, almost entirely due to COVID 19. The worst global economic contraction in 90 years has hit the poorest, most fragile countries the hardest. Noting that in 2020 aid agencies provided lifesaving assistance to almost 100 million people, he said the Global Humanitarian Response Plan for COVID 19 received nearly 4 billion from 160 donors. The funding enabled transport of over 26,000 health and humanitarian personnel and 118,000 cubic meters of critical COVID 19 cargo, as well as the provision of critical water and sanitation supplies and services to 74 million people, among other things. But it has become harder to reach people. More must be done to improve access to the most vulnerable and to ensure the safety and security of humanitarian and health workers. While the humanitarian community has managed to sustain and scale up assistance to an unprecedented level, that effort has been outpaced by the growing scale of the crisis, he said, seeking the Council’s help in three areas, including immediate and generous funding of the Global Humanitarian Overview published in December. In 2021, the United Nations coordinated humanitarian system needs 35 billion to reach 160 million people. Shareholders must do more to strengthen the support international financial institutions provide to their most vulnerable members. “It is staggering to me that of the 110 billion pledged by the international financial institutions since March, only 11.7 billion, just 10 per cent, was targeted at low income countries,” he said. And only 7 billion has actually been disbursed — the equivalent of about 10 per person, he said, calling for urgent action to ensure vaccines reach the most vulnerable people in the world. Countries should scale up their support for the Access to COVID 19 Tools ACT Accelerator and the COVAX Facility. He went on to emphasize that Governments must also fulfil their responsibility to include in their national vaccination plans all high risk populations within their territories, including refugees, internally displaced people, and people living in areas under the control of non State armed groups. It is also vital to ensure that COVID 19 vaccines do not get financed at the expense of other life saving activities in the very poorest countries. If money is diverted from routine immunization, famine relief or other health services to pay for the COVID vaccine, the result will be more not less loss of life. However, “we have reasons for hope,” he said. “The speed with which effective vaccines have been developed is a historic achievement for humanity … The next six months will be crucial.” In the ensuing discussion, delegates reiterated their support for a global ceasefire, but also emphasized the need to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of affordable COVID 19 vaccines, particularly in conflict hotspots. “No one is safe until everyone is safe,” several speakers said, warning that, as long as the pandemic continues, the risk of conflict and tension — and the threat to international peace and security — will only grow. The representative of France said the cessation of hostilities is vital for the fight against COVID 19 to be effective. Despite some progress, especially in Libya with the conclusion of a ceasefire agreement, and support by over 180 countries for the Secretary General’s appeal, the situation remains fragile in many countries. The COVID 19 vaccine must be a global public good accessible to all, she said, fully supporting the COVAX initiative. Global access will be a test for a new multilateralism. Underscoring the importance of supporting implementation of the Global Humanitarian Response Plan for COVID 19 and funding the various humanitarian response plans, she said France will continue increasing its humanitarian aid to reach 500 million euros in 2022 and such aid will be a top priority of the country’s European Union presidency in 2022. Efforts must be bolstered to limit the negative and disproportionate impact of the pandemic on women, girls, refugees and internally displaced persons especially, who must be enabled to participate fully in developing and implementing the pandemic response. Stressing the need to consolidate the multilateral health architecture around the World Health Organization WHO , she said that the current health crisis has also highlighted the need for reliable, science based information on the links between human, animal and environmental health and expressed support for the launch of the “One Health” high level council. The representative of Ireland said that the Council cannot ignore the threat to peace and security posed by the pandemic, which has increased poverty, disrupted education and worsened food insecurity — all factors that can lead to, or exacerbate, conflict. The Council must act now to prevent conflicts resulting from the interaction between the pandemic with pre existing fragilities, she said, calling for full implementation of resolution 2532 2020 . It must also carefully consider the impact of COVID 19 on peacekeeping operations, with the “Blue Helmets” taken into account during the roll out of vaccines. She went on to stress that national restrictions on movement should not hamper the ability of humanitarian and health workers to reach those in greatest need. The speaker for Kenya, underscoring the impact of COVID 19 on the most fragile countries, said that a lack of vaccines in wide parts of the world for extended periods of time could lead to mutations of the virus that would endanger everybody. Warning against vaccine nationalism, he urged Council members, including those with above average resources and industrial capacities, to show global leadership by ensuring vaccine availability and affordability for the most fragile countries and regions. With the world on the brink of a rapid unravelling of global order, vaccine access for all would be “a shot in the arm” that would make billions of people feel that the United Nations and its Member States can reach out to them, regardless of wealth or race, he said. The representative of the Russian Federation said his country was among the first to support the Secretary General’s appeal for a global ceasefire. The immediate cessation of hostilities and the introduction of a humanitarian pause in conflict zones should not apply to the fight against terrorist groups. It is important to bear in mind that a ceasefire is not the only thing resolution 2532 2020 calls for, he said, noting that the text supports the Secretary General’s call for lifting illegal unilateral sanctions that limit the capacity of developing and least developed countries to respond to the challenges due to the virus’ spread and socioeconomic consequences. Highlighting the introduction of Moscow’s “Green Corridors” — which are free of trade wars and sanctions — for delivering vital goods and medicines to countries in need, he said humanitarian aid must be provided in full respect for the sovereignty of the recipient States without any preconditions. He voiced concern about growing efforts to remove these fundamental provisions from resolutions to renew the mandates of United Nations peacekeeping operations. Expressing support for the role of WHO, he said the Russian Federation created and registered the world’s first vaccine against coronavirus, namely “SPUTNIK V”, and is providing the vaccine on a bilateral basis. The proposal to provide the Russian vaccine free for United Nations personnel remains on the table, he added. The speaker for the United Kingdom said implementation of the ceasefire resolution continues to be mixed, citing examples in Yemen, South Sudan and Sudan. In addition, women’s voices have been side lined in peace processes, he said, calling for their full participation alongside youth, religious groups and non governmental organizations. Clearly, the pandemic threatens international peace and security, and ending it requires equitable global access to vaccines, yet there are barriers to delivery in conflict contexts. When the United Kingdom assumes the Council presidency, it will convene a meeting to address potential obstacles to vaccine access such as ceasefires, logistics and funding, he said. The representative of China, describing 2021 as a critical year in the fight against COVID 19, said that the Council should bolster implementation of resolution 2532 2020 . All parties to conflict should unconditionally cease hostilities and focus instead on the front line of the pandemic, in coordination with United Nations missions. Supply chains should be stabilized to guarantee the delivery of humanitarian supplies, and the health and safety of United Nations personnel ensured, including through a feasible vaccination programme. He called for the lifting of unilateral sanctions as soon as possible, adding that the politicization of the pandemic will only lead to the further spread of the novel coronavirus. The speaker for India said many ceasefires announced after the global call were not negotiated, and have either expired or broken down, with conflicts intensifying in some cases. He nonetheless reiterated the call for a comprehensive ceasefire in Afghanistan, welcoming that resolution 2532 2020 had the foresight to recognize the threats posed by State sponsors of terror and ensure that the Secretary General’s call did not apply to Council listed individuals and terrorist entities. India’s response to the call included the provision of health and medical supplies to more than 150 countries and 15 million pledged to GAVI. Moreover, India’s scientists, medical fraternity, industry, academia and Government worked in tandem to develop a vaccine, with three candidates now in advanced trial stages. Countries engaging in cross border terrorism must be called out and held accountable, he said, pressing the Council to prioritize support for efforts that ensure economic recovery in conflict areas, as well as speedy, equitable distribution of vaccines and therapeutics. The representative of Norway said her country echoed the call for a global ceasefire by encouraging parties to conflict to adhere to that appeal. “However, as we have all seen, the response has not been sufficient,” she said, acknowledging that most ceasefires announced were unilateral, limited and lacking follow up mechanisms for coordination, monitoring and conflict management. She underscored the importance of encouraging parties to make mutual commitments, allowing ceasefires to serve their purpose — whether vaccine distribution or steps towards a settlement. She commended the Secretary General’s swift response to Norway’s proposal to establish the COVID 19 Response and Recovery Fund in March 2020, advocating continued support for national authorities, protection of United Nations personnel, and more broadly, for human rights, the rule of law and gender equality to underpin the global response to COVID 19. It is the Council’s duty to watch the shifting dynamics around conflicts, coordinate efforts and facilitate both humanitarian access and peaceful resolution, when possible, she stressed. The representative of the United States pledged to work with other countries and international organizations, stressing that the new United States President signed a letter on 20 January retracting his predecessor’s decision to withdraw from WHO. Despite the devastating impact of COVID 19, there is “light at the end of tunnel”, he said, citing the development of numerous vaccines and therapeutics within a year of the outbreak. As stated by chief medical officer Anthony Fauci, the United States will play a key role in strengthening global health security and provide support to the COVAX Facility, while seeking to reform WHO. He expressed concern over the capacity of conflict affected countries to fight COVID 19, urging parties to either abide by their ceasefire agreements or reach new accords that ensure aid delivery. Condemning terrorist groups for exploiting the pandemic, he said Washington, D.C., will continue to pursue its legitimate anti terrorism operations, and to support vulnerable countries and populations dealing with the second order effects of COVID 19. The representative of Niger underscored the imperative of ensuring fair distribution of COVID 19 vaccines, warning countries against using these medicines as a way to advance their hegemonistic ambitions or expand their influence. Fighting the pandemic requires international and regional cooperation. Noting that the Economic Community of West African States ECOWAS is implementing measures to guarantee the distribution of vaccines to low income countries through the COVAX Facility, he said the pandemic has “added a new layer” of development challenges in the Sahel, an area that is already dealing with the impact of climate change. He called for the lifting of unilateral sanctions, which undermine the delivery of humanitarian aid. The representative of Estonia said the pandemic is an unprecedented situation that requires greater cooperation, strong multilateralism and, in the Council, strength and unity in dealing with its security implications. Resources must go towards tackling the virus, not attacking health organizations and citizens only, he said, emphasizing that all Member States must follow the norms of responsible State behaviour in cyberspace. Using COVID 19 as justification for lifting sanctions is misleading, as targeted sanctions play no role in how well a country deals with the pandemic, he said, adding that curtailing human rights and restricting civil space under the pretext of the virus is unacceptable. The representative of Viet Nam said mixed success prevails in implementing a global ceasefire. Access to the vaccine remains uneven at a time when underlying causes of conflict are likely to be affected in the long run while facing risks of exploitation by extremists and terrorists. Offering several recommendations, he said the ceasefire must be strengthened to protect people from both conflict and COVID 19. United Nations peacekeeping operations must be made safer and stronger, with increased medical capacities to better protect peacekeepers and civilians. Indeed, Member States should support a robust and resilient global health system, with WHO playing a crucial role. While being a “first step” in recognizing the immediate danger of COVID 19 to global security, resolution 2532 2020 requires a follow up to ensure its effective implementation, he said, adding that “The people in countries in situations of armed conflict or affected by humanitarian crises look to the Council for its continued unity, solidarity and leadership we must not fail them.” The representative of Mexico, commending Tunisia and France for leading the adoption of resolution 2532 2020 , urged the Council to both renew and strengthen its commitment to a common purpose. The resolution was a step in the right direction, but it should have been adopted “much earlier”, he said, calling for redoubled efforts to ensure post pandemic recovery, and pressing the Council to play a more active role in the search for solutions through a prevention approach. Welcoming the decision by the United States to join the COVAX Facility, he said the move is in line with General Assembly resolution 74 274, introduced by Mexico in April 2020 and co sponsored by 178 countries. He also recognized efforts by the Group of Friends of Solidarity for Global Health Security in raising awareness about the impact of global health crises on international security. “Not recognizing such a dimension is to shirk our responsibility,” he said. The representative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines said that successfully addressing the simultaneous challenges of COVID 19 and conflict requires greater political will scaled up humanitarian and developmental assistance full respect for international law, including international humanitarian law and earnest efforts towards pursuing dialogue, compromise and reconciliation. No effort must be spared to ensure that vaccines are equitably available to all. In that regard, she called for greater financial support for the COVAX initiative as well as a rules based compact between all States and major pharmaceutical companies to ensure the universal distribution of affordable COVID‑19 vaccines. “As we seek to recover from this pandemic, let us also seek to advance peace and justice for all in accordance with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,” she added. The representative of Tunisia, Council President for January, spoke in his national capacity, stressing the importance of a joint and coordinated response to the pandemic under United Nations auspices. Recalling that resolution 2532 2020 was adopted by the Council following an initiative by Tunisia and France, he reaffirmed the urgent need for a global ceasefire. He also emphasized the need for equal access to vaccines, stating that failure in that regard is liable to deepen sentiments of injustice and, in turn, raise tensions. It would also run counter to the principles of human solidarity and collective security. He went on urge the Council to follow up on resolution 2532 2020 by developing mechanisms for its implementation. For information media. Not an official record.",['Epidemic']
"I am shocked and horrified by the many lives claimed by the devastating fires that hit the Pedrógão Grande region of Portugal. Earlier today, I spoke with the President of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, and with the Prime Minister, António Costa, to express my deep sadness and condolences to the Portuguese Government and people. I wish a speedy recovery to the injured. At this time of loss, my thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones of the victims. I commend the Government, firefighters, emergency responders and civil society organizations who are sparing no efforts to battle the wildfire and help people in need. The United Nations stands ready to assist in any way possible.",['Wild Fire']
"DSG SM 1691 DEPUTY SECRETARY GENERAL Following are UN Deputy Secretary General Amina Mohammed’s opening remarks at the international event for the financing of the reconstruction of the Southern Peninsula of Haiti, in Port au Prince today I would like to begin by thanking the Government of Haiti for convening this conference and thanking all our partners for your commitment to support the people of Haiti. Six months ago, I came to Haiti with the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme UNDP , Achim Steiner, to convey our solidarity in the immediate aftermath of the tragic earthquake that struck the Southern Peninsula. I witnessed the human suffering and destruction caused by the disaster, at a time when Haiti was already facing multiple crises. Crises that conspired to hold back Haiti’s development and erode progress. Today, I am back in Haiti with a renewed sense of optimism and hope, as we gather in partnership to overcome these setbacks and move forward with determination on the path to sustainable development. Much has happened in the last six months. With strong Government leadership, and in partnership with communities and international stakeholders, emergency relief has been provided to 600,000 people in need. As the response unfolded, the Haitian Government took important steps towards recovery and reconstruction. It brought together national actors and international partners — including the United Nations — to work with one common goal to ensure Haiti recovers better from the crisis, and to get back on track to implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Government’s Southern Peninsula Integrated Recovery Plan offers a very clear path ahead. It draws on the lessons learned from the responses to the devastating 2010 earthquake and Hurricane Matthew in 2016. It anchors our firm action and national leadership and reasserts the pre eminence of local and national actors. The Recovery Plan is an opportunity to shift focus to prevention, risk reduction and resilience to future shocks. The plan’s four priorities — institutional strengthening and inclusive governance economic recovery resilient infrastructure and livelihoods improvement and inclusion and social protection — offer a coherent and integrated approach to reconstruction. It focuses on the structural causes, rather than the symptoms of disasters. It looks at this crisis as an opportunity to invest in the local economy and communities. As an opportunity to invest in national capacities, both in the public and the private sectors. It recognizes that affected communities must be front and centre of decisions that affect their lives, but also their livelihoods. Within those communities, women and girls must be agents of their own recovery. In its ambition, it reminds us that the response to the 2021 earthquake can and must move Haiti towards developing a much more robust, effective and nationally led agenda. I have heard many times during my visits to Haiti that Haitians are tired of missed opportunities and failed promises. This time around, we must get it right. We are aware that aid budgets are under pressure across the globe. We also know there is donor fatigue. And we have heard, loud and clear, concerns about the results of aid in Haiti. But, this is not the time to give up. First, because the people of Haiti never give up. Time and time again, they mourn their losses, and then they pick themselves up and put their lives back together. Second, because Haiti is again at a crossroads. Years of investment in stability and development must be protected. And national institutions are clearly ready to lead. But, they need our solidarity. And we need Haiti to succeed. We have an immediate opportunity to break out of the cycle of crises that has constrained Haiti’s development for so long. The 2010 earthquake demonstrated that when recovery efforts are well‑designed, transparent and accountable, and aligned to national priorities, they deliver tangible results in the lives and livelihoods of Haitians. From the impressive debris‑management efforts, to the pioneering efforts to relocate millions of displaced people, to efforts to stop the transmission of cholera — there are many inspiring examples of what Haitians have been able to succeed at. Working together, under national leadership, we can achieve results for people, and value for the resources that are spent. We need to be aware that the lack of adequate and timely investment in reconstruction will inevitably push the most vulnerable populations, who will no longer have the means to sustain their livelihoods, towards negative survival strategies. Internal migration is likely to increase, including to Port au Prince, which already faces serious social and economic challenges and high levels of violence. External migration is also like to increase as Haitians seek opportunities overseas, draining the country’s talent pool. Investment is essential to support the Haitian Government in providing education, training, job opportunities, and most of all, hope for a better future for Haitians and Haiti. We know that the total amount needed to repair and rebuild, with resilience, estimated at roughly 2 billion, may seem daunting to many. We are also aware that Haiti is facing institutional and security challenges that threaten longer term development. And we all agree that we need an enabling environment to move the needle, ultimately, upholding good governance and transparency around results and impact in people’s lives, especially, women and youth. Today, we are calling for support for the immediate needs of the people in the south. For their homes, for their schools, for their hospitals and for their livelihoods. For this, the Government needs approximately 500 million — an amount that is within our reach and that can help put Haiti back on the right trajectory. I am confident we can make this a reality here today and can contribute to this first step towards reconstruction and rebuilding lives. Let me stress once again the importance of focusing on the long standing structural causes of Haiti’s challenges. Development deficits over the years and even decades have given rise to high humanitarian needs and instability. The Haitian people, especially women and the youth — like people everywhere in our global community — deserve a stable, peaceful and prosperous future. Today, we have an opportunity to get closer to that goal. An opportunity to show that we have learned from the mistakes of the past — and that we know how to make smart and sustainable investments. That we can recognize national leadership when it is in motion and that we can invest in it. Today, we reaffirm our commitment to stand with Haiti and its people, and to support the country’s recovery towards sustainable development, democracy, stability and peace. The people of Haiti must always come first. For information media. Not an official record. .",['Earthquake']
"Bulletin of the Global Volcanism Network, vol. 46, no. 3 March 2021 Managing Editor Edward Venzke. Edited by A. Elizabeth Crafford. Pacaya Guatemala Increasing activity with ash emissions, explosions, and lava flows on multiple flanks during December 2020 February 2021 Please cite this report as Global Volcanism Program, 2021. Report on Pacaya Guatemala Crafford, A.E., and Venzke, E., eds. . Bulletin of the Global Volcanism Network , 46 3. Smithsonian Institution. Pacaya Guatemala 14.382°N, 90.601°W summit elev. 2569 m All times are local unless otherwise noted Extensive lava flows, bomb laden Strombolian explosions, and ash plumes emerging from Mackenney crater have characterized the persistent activity at Pacaya since 1961. The latest eruptive episode began with intermittent ash plumes and incandescence in June 2015 the growth of a new pyroclastic cone inside the summit crater was confirmed later that year. The cone has continued to grow, producing frequent loud Strombolian explosions rising above the crater rim and ongoing ash emissions. In addition, fissures on the flanks of the summit crater have been the source of an increasing number of lava flows traveling distances of over one kilometer down multiple flanks during 2019 and into 2021. Increasing explosive and effusive activity during December 2020 February 2021 is covered in this report with information provided by Guatemala's Instituto Nacional de Sismologia, Vulcanologia, Meteorologia e Hydrologia INSIVUMEH , multiple sources of satellite data, and numerous photographs from observers on the ground. Eruptive activity increased substantially during December 2020 February 2021. During December, ash emissions were reported fewer than half the days of the month by February, dense ash emissions drifted many kilometers most days, and ashfall was reported numerous times in the surrounding communities. Strombolian explosions in December generally rose 50 125 m above the summit of the pyroclastic cone by February they were commonly rising 300 m or more and sending ejecta 500 m from the summit. Numerous lava flows were reported on the NW, W, and S flanks during the period a flow that emerged on the SSW flank on 7 January 2021 persisted through the end of February and was 800 1,200 m long. Strombolian activity also occurred at the fissure where the flow emerged, and incandescent blocks rolled hundreds of meters beyond the front of the flow. A steady increase in thermal activity was recorded with the MIROVA Log Radiative Power graph during December 2020 – February 2021 figure 145 . This corresponded to the persistent lava flows on multiple flanks and constant Strombolian activity. Multiple MODVOLC thermal alerts were issued many days each month during the period. The Washington VAAC reported an ash emission at Pacaya that rose to 3.0 km altitude and drifted WSW on 3 December 2020 it dissipated within a few hours. INSIVUMEH reported daily gas and steam plumes that rose a few hundred meters and sometimes drifted as far as 10 km. They also reported ash emissions along with the gas and steam on 10, 12 14, 16 18, 24 25, and 28 December. The ash plumes usually rose 300 400 m and drifted a few kilometers with the wind. On the evening of 28 December ash reached populated places including San José El Rodeo. Strombolian explosions at the summit occurred daily and rose 50 125 m above the Mackenney crater rim figure 146 . Ejecta was reported to heights of 250 m on 13 December and 200 m on 21 December. Lava flow activity continued on the SW flank throughout December 2020 and high winds remobilized ash on the flanks a number of times during the month. On 1 December the flow was about 675 m long and moving to the SW. Two branches were active the next day and three were reported on 6 December. A second flow appeared on the NW flank on 9 December on the plateau near Cerro Chino and grew to 250 m long figure 147 . Both flows had incandescent block avalanches spalling off their fronts and rolling at least 100 m. The SW flank flow remained 450 550 m long through 11 December, and then grew to around 700 m the next day. Branches from both flows extended 700 1,000 m by 15 December and were moving NW, W, and SW. The NW flank flow was growing through 16 December. Three 600 m long branches were active on the SW flank flow on 21 December. In a special bulletin released on 23 December, INSIVUMEH noted that the SW flank flow was still active from the same mid flank fissure where it originated on 20 October 2020, and consisted of 5 7 branches with lengths varying from 600 750 m figure 148 . For the remainder of December, multiple branches of the active SW flank flow were between 525 and 650 m long, with block avalanches falling off the front that generated ash clouds. In a special bulletin issued on 1 January 2021 INSIVUMEH reported an increase in eruptive activity that produced Strombolian explosions which sent ejecta 300 m high and up to 100 m from the summit. Constant rumblings like a train and shock waves were heard and felt in nearby communities. Strombolian explosions continued to rise 75 200 m above the rim throughout the month, and numerous gas emissions rose 100 300 m and drifted as far as 10 km figure 149 . Ash emissions were noted on 1, 6, 7, 11, 13, 18, 19, 21 23, 25, 27, and 31 January. On 7 January ash drifted SW at 3 km altitude and ejecta was reported 300 m from the summit. INSIVUMEH noted that the columns of ash reached 300 500 m above the crater that day, generating loud rumbling and shock waves that vibrated roofs and windows in nearby villages. On 12 January explosions sent material 300 m high. A VAAC report on 22 January noted an ash plume drifting NW from the summit at 3.4 km altitude. INSIVUMEH remarked in a special report that day that ash fell in San Vicente Pacaya and in San Francisco de Sales. The ash emissions on 25 January were brown to gray, sporadic overnight and more continuous in the early morning, drifting 1 4 km W. On 27 and 31 January ash drifted 10 km W. Multiple lava flows emerged from the flanks of Pacaya during January 2021. The lava flow that began on 20 October 2020 on the W flank continued to be active through about 8 January with branches flowing 400 600 m W and SW. A flow on the SSW flank began on 2 January from a vent 200 m below the rim of Mackenney crater. By 6 January it was feeding 3 4 flows from the same point, each 400 m long with block avalanches falling off the fronts and moving W, SW, and S down the flanks figure 150 . In the morning of 7 January two flows were seen on the N flank, 200 and 50 m long. Later that night another flow appeared on the SSW flank that lengthened rapidly, reaching 425 m the next day, and was 1,200 m long on 9 January figure 151 . High temperatures were still present on the W and SW flanks from the earlier flows. The SSW flow reached 1,500 m in length on 10 January and fluctuated between 1,200 and 1,600 m through 17 January when Strombolian activity ejecting material 5 10 m high was reported from the fissure. More Strombolian activity at the fissure was noted on 22 January, and the flow remained 800 1,150 m long through the 23rd. The flow reached 1,700 m in length on 25 January for the rest of the month, it was reported as 800 1,000 m long, with block avalanches traveling an additional 200 400 m from the flow front. Strombolian activity reached 65 m high from the fissure at the head of the flow on 28 January. On 30 January multiple branches of the SSW flow were visible from a vantage point south of the volcano figure 152 . Increased Strombolian activity during February 2021 was accompanied by frequent ash emissions that rose to 3.0 3.5 km altitude. The explosions often reached 225 m above the crater rim, and higher during pulses of increased activity. On 5 February ash drifted W, NW, and SW about 4 km and ashfall was reported in San Francisco de Sales, Concepcion el Cedro, and Calderas. A pulse of increased Strombolian activity on 6 February sent ejecta 400 500 m around the pyroclastic cone and columns of ash drifted 6 km NW and N. Ashfall was reported in the same areas as the day before, plus in El Bejucal, Mesías Altas and other communities in that region. Abundant ash emissions were reported by INSIVUMEH overnight on 7 8 February variable winds dispersed the ash 30 km to the NW and W and 10 km N figure 153 . The ash emissions were accompanied by ejecta that landed 300 m from the summit. By the next day, ash had drifted as far as 66 km W and NW and ashfall was reported in El Patrocinio, El Rodeo, and El Caracol. Prolonged rumbling as loud as an airplane engine was reported from strong degassing. The Washington VAAC reported ash emissions in satellite imagery on 9 February at 3.8 km altitude drifting NW about 65 km from the summit. High levels of similar activity continued through 10 February when 500 m high ejecta was observed inside Mackenney crater. An increase in the seismic amplitude on 11 February was accompanied by ash plumes rising to 3.0 3.2 km altitude and drifting 15 20 km W and SW. Ashfall was reported in Patrocinio and El Rodeo. The next day ashfall was reported in San Francisco de Sales, San Jose Calderas, and Concepción el Cedro. On 13 February the Washington VAAC reported ash plumes visible in satellite imagery at 4.3 km altitude moving ENE, and ash fell in Santa Elena Barillas, Mesillas Bajas, and Mesillas Altas as the wind carried ash 6 km W, N, and NE ash on 14 February drifted 5 km E. A new pulse of activity late on 16 February, the third in a week, produced incandescent material 400 m high high pressure gas also created plane engine noises, with roofs and windows rattled in nearby communities. Ashfall from the event was reported in Los Llanos, Los Pocitos, El Cedro, and other communities within 4 km. Another pulse on 18 February sent ejecta 200 m high, variable winds sent ash primarily NE and S. Two more pulses of activity on the morning of 19 February were recorded as increases in seismic amplitude by the PCG5 seismic station figure 154 . The first pulse was accompanied by a new lava flow appearing on the NW flank. The second pulse coincided with ash emissions that rose 500 m above the crater and drifted 8 km S, producing ashfall in Los Pocitos and plantations in that vicinity. Ash emissions from explosions on 20 February drifted 10 25 km S and SW, resulting in ashfall in El Rodeo and El Patrocinio. That evening incandescent material rose 300 400 m above the summit and ejecta reached 500 m down the flanks of the cone figure 155 . The next day ash plumes rose to 2.8 3.2 km altitude and drifted SW with ashfall reported in San Francisco de Sales, El Cedro, and other plantations in the area figure 156 . During 22 24 February ash emissions rose as high as 800 m above the summit and drifted 3 5 km W, SW, and S. Ashfall drifted over 30 km S and SW on 24 February with ashfall reported in the villages of Los Pocitos, Pacaya, El Rodeo, and El Patrocinio. Pulses of increased activity on 26 February produced an ash plume 2.5 km above the summit. With variable wind directions at different altitudes, the ash drifted both N and S. The Washington VAAC reported the plume drifting N at 3.9 km altitude. This activity was accompanied by incandescent explosions that rose 500 m above the Mackenney crater, and noises as loud as an airplane engine. Similar pulses of activity continued through the end of the month, producing ash plumes that rose to 3.5 km altitude and drifted W and SW ashfall was reported in El Patrocinio on 28 February. The lava flow on the SSW flank was about 900 m long at the beginning of February with block avalanches falling about 100 m from the front of the flow, and Strombolian explosions active at the fissure at the head of the flow. Two distinct branches of the flow were visible on 6 February, one 1,200 and one 800 m long multiple branches were active throughout the month figure 157 . High levels of activity continued during 10 12 February the flow was 1,200 1,300 m long and loose blocks were descending an additional 200 m. During 13 18 February high temperature zones were still present on the N and NW flanks from earlier flows. From 14 18 February the S flank flow was 900 1,100 m long with multiple branches and Strombolian activity at the vent figure 158 . A new flow appeared briefly on the NW flank during 19 20 February. High temperature zones remained on the NW flank during 22 24 February. The S flank flow remained active throughout the rest of February and was 800 1,100 m long, with incandescent blocks traveling up to 600 m beyond the flow fronts figure 159 . Geological Summary. Eruptions from Pacaya, one of Guatemala's most active volcanoes, are frequently visible from Guatemala City, the nation's capital. This complex basaltic volcano was constructed just outside the southern topographic rim of the 14 x 16 km Pleistocene Amatitlán caldera. A cluster of dacitic lava domes occupies the southern caldera floor. The post caldera Pacaya massif includes the ancestral Pacaya Viejo and Cerro Grande stratovolcanoes and the currently active Mackenney stratovolcano. Collapse of Pacaya Viejo between 600 and 1500 years ago produced a debris avalanche deposit that extends 25 km onto the Pacific coastal plain and left an arcuate somma rim inside which the modern Pacaya volcano Mackenney cone grew. A subsidiary crater, Cerro Chino, was constructed on the NW somma rim and was last active in the 19th century. During the past several decades, activity has consisted of frequent strombolian eruptions with intermittent lava flow extrusion that has partially filled in the caldera moat and armored the flanks of Mackenney cone, punctuated by occasional larger explosive eruptions that partially destroy the summit of the growing young stratovolcano.

" Highlights Situation This winter has brought harsh conditions including sub zero temperatures, freezing rain and snow across Syria and countries hosting Syrian refugees, compounding the impact of the ongoing conflicts and displacement on vulnerable children and their families. There are reports of child deaths in Syria and Lebanon, as well an increase in illnesses, such as upper respiratory tract infections, associated with exposure to cold temperatures. Overall Response • To date UNICEF has distributed winter clothing, blankets, heating supplies, cash and vouchers, with 916,000 children in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey of the 1.3 million target children benefitting from all or part of the winter support package. Note Targets and results are pending updates from Turkey. • UNICEF has focused the response in elevated areas of the countries and on young children. • UNICEF requires US 11.3 million for remaining winter response interventions for vulnerable children. Syria • Winter clothing, blankets and school heaters distributed so far to benefit 315,000 children of the 400,000 children originally targeted. However, with the Non Food Item sector under funded UNICEF now plans to target an additional 100,000 children, and urgently requires US 5 million. • An additional 35,000 children have received blankets in North and South Syria under the Whole of Syria approach. • Funding gaps are US 5 million to urgently procure additional winter supplies. Iraq • Winter clothing kits have so far been distributed to over 200,000 children in over 100 hard to reach and high altitude. Additionally UNICEF has distributed thermal blankets is supporting school winterization with oil heaters, and insulation and is providing emergency water and sanitation services and supplies to displaced populations. • Sustainable water networks have been put in place in Kirkuk, Khanaqin, Sulaymaniyah, Erbil and Dahuk. • Gaps remain significant with 200,000 children living in poor households requiring blankets and hygiene supplies. Lebanon • 80,000 children 0 14 years old living in high altitude tented settlements received winter kits between November and December 2014, prior to the arrival of the winter storm, representing approximately 70 of the Syrian children residing in informal settlements across Lebanon. An additional 20,000 Palestinian children received vouchers for clothing. • An additional 104,200 children benefited from UNICEF response measures including drainage kits, safe drinking water, plastic sheeting, and High Energy Biscuits. • UNICEF has just received approval from Ministry of Education and Higher Education to commence delivery of fuel for classroom heating for 583 schools to benefit 155,000 children.

" Highlights According to the Office of the Prime Minister OPM and UNHCR, a total of 14,909 new refugees arrived in Uganda in September from South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo DRC , and Burundi, bringing Uganda’s total refugee and asylum seeking population to 1.36 million.1 UNICEF reached over 2,900 households impacted by flooding in Eastern Uganda this month with water, sanitation and hygiene WASH supplies and Communication for Development C4D materials on cholera prevention. Through the nationwide mass measles rubella MR vaccination campaign, which took place from 16 to 22 October, the Ministry of Health, WHO, UNICEF and partners reached 19,425,918 children including in refugee settlements. UNICEF continues to intensify risk communication and social mobilization activities, as well as interventions on infection prevention and control IPC through WASH, child protection, and nutrition. UNICEF and partners reached an additional 54,610 people through direct interpersonal engagement during house to house visits and community meetings in 10 high risk districts, bringing the total number of people reached with key messages to 706,516. Situation Overview and Humanitarian Needs Refugees Uganda continues to host the largest number of refugees in Africa, with over 1.36 million refugees and asylum seekers within its borders, according to UNHCR and the Office of the Prime Minister OPM .1 Of those, 854,859 are from South Sudan, 389,276 from DRC, 44,611 from Burundi, and nearly 74,000 from Somalia, Rwanda and other nearby countries. Sixty one per cent of Uganda’s refugee population – or over 830,000 persons – are children. The average daily influx in October included 70 persons from South Sudan and 130 from DRC, compared to September arrivals of 29 and 168, respectively. Disease Outbreaks As of 31 October, there were no reported Ebola virus disease EVD cases or contacts under follow up. Nevertheless, Uganda continues to be at very high risk of EVD importation from DRC. The last confirmed EVD case was reported in Kasese district on 29 August 2019. On 11 October, Uganda marked 42 days since the death of the last confirmed case, and declared the EVD outbreak officially over. During the reporting period, 7,945 frontline health workers, contacts, and their contacts in 14 districts had been vaccinated against EVD. Uganda currently has only 240 doses of Ebola vaccine that are reserved for immediate response to another EVD outbreak. The National Task Force NTF on outbreaks, district task forces DTFs in high risk districts and their sub committees, and the United Nations EVD team continue to meet to review the EVD situation and coordinate related preparedness and response activities. However, the frequency of the meetings has declined partly because of other priorities and growing fatigue. On 21 October 2019, a delegation led by the Minister of Health MoH participated in the High Level Ministerial Meeting on Cross Border Collaboration between Uganda and DRC. The delegation also included the WHO Representative, Uganda Immigration Services, and Uganda Red Cross Society. The meeting led to the finalization of the bilateral Memorandum of Understanding between Uganda and DRC on cross border collaboration for EVD and other public health events. In addition, NTF approved the organization of another cross border meeting scheduled to take place on 5 November 2019 to strengthen risk communication and community engagement. The meeting will be conducted under the leadership of the district local governments of Kasese Uganda and Kasindi DRC , with support from OPM, WHO, UNICEF Uganda, and UNICEF DRC.","['Drought', 'Epidemic', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Mud Slide']"

" Highlights Since January 2020, UNICEF operated with a limited number of international staff on the ground and by December all international staff had temporarily exited the country due to continued border closures and travel restrictions related to COVID 19 prevention measures. The UNICEF Country Office remains open and continues to support essential basic service delivery in Health, Immunization, Water, Sanitation and Hygiene WASH , Nutrition and COVID 19 response despite disruptions. The Country Office is now managed remotely by interntional staff with support from seconded national staff. There have been no official reported cases of COVID 19 in DPRK. However, strict prevention measures have indirectly impacted humanitarian operations thus reducing the scope and delivery of UNICEF’s Country Programme. Meanwhile humanitarian needs have increased and the situation threatens to reverse significant progress made on key indicators of child welfare. In the first half of 2020, prevention measures delayed the importation of lifesaving supplies. Nonetheless, UNICEF did manage to bring in a number of critical supplies including but not limited to BCG and Pentavalent vaccines. However, from August onwards, there has been a complete suspension of humanitarian supply flows across the border. UNICEF received only US 8.6 million from the US 22.5 million funding requirement, leaving the programme 62 per cent unfunded thus limiting UNICEF’s ability to provide life saving services for children across sectors.

" ADRA AND THE ADVENTIST CHURCH TEAM UP IN HISTORIC COLLABORATION TO RESPOND TO THE GLOBAL COVID 19 CRISIS ADRA worked closely with Adventist churches in 7 out of 10 projects to deliver assistance while many churches were closed SILVER SPRING, MD November 19, 2020 — Since the onset of the COVID 19 pandemic this year, the Adventist Development and Relief Agency ADRA , the global humanitarian arm of the Seventh day Adventist church, has been responding globally to help nearly 20 million survive the significant health challenges and economic impact that the pandemic has created. This global response has created 422 projects so far in 96 countries and has resulted in a historic collaboration between ADRA and the Adventist church during a time when many churches were closed. ADRA has outlined this collaboration and the significant impact of this global response in a new COVID 19 Global Report, which ADRA published. “ADRA reaffirms its commitment to continue to respond to the urgent needs of disadvantaged communities heavily impacted by the COVID 19 global crisis. Our global emergency taskforce, in coordination with the Adventist church and our trusted partners is making significant progress in helping vulnerable families recover from the difficult challenges of this pandemic,” says Michael Kruger, ADRA’s president. “We are grateful to the Adventist church for the significant support it has provided, as well as to our donors and volunteers for their continued assistance. We pray that this aid will give comfort and hope to every person we help and a sense of Jesus’ love and compassion.” ADRA’s COVID 19 Global Report outlines how the agency pivoted from existing development projects to scale up a major response by establishing a global taskforce to implement a new approach. This helped ADRA scale up humanitarian assistance worldwide and leverage limited funds into a 26 million response that included Adventist church entities, governments, multi lateral organizations, nonprofit organizations, corporations and other trusted partners to ensure vulnerable communities had access to life saving essentials and life sustaining support. This included awareness and health promotion, water and sanitation, health training, personal protective equipment PPE , medical supplies, food security, and psycho social support to vulnerable populations, frontline workers and first responders. Seventy percent of ADRA’s COVID 19 response operations were established or adapted rapidly in partnership with the Adventist church with minimal or no funding. Despite the office closures and disruptions caused by the pandemic, ADRA successfully executed projects in multiple countries and multiple continents including the following regions NORTH AMERICA – 69 PROJECTS IMPACTING 714,000 PEOPLE ADRA partnered with the North American Division of Seventh day Adventists NAD to donate USD 4 million in personal protective equipment PPEs , medical supplies, food and cash assistance to Adventist run food pantries across the United States and Canada. The donation supported medical facilities facing severe supply shortages in U.S. suburban communities such as Texas, California, Maryland, and New York. More than 200 pallets of PPEs, face shields, gloves and essential medical supplies were delivered to the facilities. In Canada, 510 Adventist volunteers from 39 churches also delivered food baskets, hygiene kits, psycho social support and cash vouchers to nearly 30,000 people. INTER AMERICA – 10 PROJECTS SERVING 54,000 PEOPLE ADRA used innovative ways to adapt or change existing projects and create new ones to support migrants, refugees and vulnerable populations during the pandemic. The initiatives totaling USD 339,000 ranged from health prevention awareness campaigns, mental health counseling, food security, crisis management training, to PPEs and medical supply donations, as well as water and sanitation projects. ADRA’s relief operations in this region covered at least nine countries, including Colombia, where hundreds of Seventh day Adventist employees donated one day of their salary to support families affected by the pandemic. In El Salvador, efforts helped more than 6,000 small business entrepreneurs and families working in agricultural projects to adapt their skills to continue earning livelihoods during the coronavirus crisis. SOUTH AMERICA – 101 PROJECTS HELPING 764,000 PEOPLE ADRA worked closely with the Adventist church and local partners to respond to the region’s health, social and economic crisis. The response, valued at more than USD 8.8 million, included at least eight countries. The efforts featured mobile laundry and decontamination services in Argentina and Brazil where trained volunteers washed, dried, and sanitized more than 20 tons of clothes regularly for COVID 19 patients. Initiatives also included public health training and assistance to support 13,000 recipients in over 47 health centers for the homeless and trafficked children and adolescents. EUROPE – 32 PROJECTS IMPACTING 42,000 PEOPLE ADRA’s response in Europe raised local funds to support the most vulnerable populations in developing countries around the world, as well as those inside the European region. The projects worth USD 688,000 were located in some 14 countries. In the United Kingdom, ADRA focused on community hubs for the homeless, refugees, and people with chronic conditions. In Hungary, children received laptops so they could study online. In Albania, students at risk of dropping out of school received tutoring videos via WhatsApp, and in Russia, ADRA volunteers made and distributed 70,000 masks for 35,000 people in disadvantaged communities and health workers. Ten European ADRA offices supported humanitarian activities in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Additional relief projects for the underserved communities are already underway in South Sudan, Yemen, Tanzania, Lebanon, Sudan, some West African countries, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. AFRICA – 47 PROJECTS SERVING 16 MILLION PEOPLE While COVID 19 cases in Africa have not surged at the same levels as other regions, the effects of the pandemic and recent natural disasters in the region have created a refugee and food security crisis. To address the challenges facing Africa, ADRA launched 47 projects worth USD 8 million, including activities focused on water and sanitation for more than 53,000 households and orphans, food and hygiene kits for more than 3,600 displaced people in Mali, and protective gear and medical supplies for health professionals serving more than 72,0000 families in Mozambique. ASIA 75 PROJECTS HELPING NEARLY 2 MILLION PEOPLE In Asia, ADRA worked closely with the Adventist church as well as the European Union, governments, corporations, United Nations agencies, and other local partners to ensure the development achievements of recent years were not lost. To this end, ADRA carried out 75 projects worth nearly USD 1.7 million in at least 15 nations, and many activities focused on adapting existing development projects to educate communities about COVID 19 prevention. Other activities specialized in training community members to use proper sanitation and providing medical resources to community health centers. ADRA in Cambodia helped more than 10,000 households and 800 health workers through COVID 19 projects targeting community health centers. In the Philippines, ADRA leveraged partnerships with the Adventist University of the Philippines to provide psychosocial support for health workers.

The 49 projects totaled USD 1.9 million and were implemented in at least six countries. Some of the activities centered on reaching communities with more than 800 dialects, in places like Papua New Guinea PNG , where ADRA launched prevention awareness initiatives with multiple communication and education campaigns to ensure communities understand the threat and reduce their risk of infection. ADRA also trained women and other vulnerable community members to make soap, masks, and other products to sell to improve incomes in the community. In Australia, ADRA provided food and counseling to more than 10,000 low income residents, migrant families and vulnerable international students who cannot access government benefits. MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA REGION – 27 PROJECTS SERVING 260,000 PEOPLE In the Middle East and North Africa MENA region, ADRA covers 20 countries including Lebanon, Iraq, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen. During the pandemic, ADRA has been meeting the emergency needs on the ground by forming alliances with local partners and the Adventist church to increase COVID 19 awareness. The 27 projects in the region totaling USD 419,000 are supporting refugees, low income residents, and families affected by civil wars and impacted by recent disasters, such as the Beirut, Lebanon explosion that happened in August. ADRA is also working to prevent the spread of the coronavirus by providing thousands of medical supplies and PPEs to hospitals that were damaged in the explosion serving vulnerable families and children. In Yemen, ADRA has sponsored COVID 19 prevention training and distributed hygiene kits to more than 2,500 households as part of a Danish government funded project. In Tunisia, more than 400 community members who lost their job, due to the pandemic, received cash vouchers and in Sudan, water and sanitation support from ADRA in Canada is helping communities to have access to essential cleaning supplies. “As we move forward, we expect to face greater challenges than we have so far. But we are prepared to face them head on. As we serve so many affected communities, ADRA will continue to carry out relief operations founded on the principle that we are stronger together—together with our partners and with the Adventist church. Our global offices, churches, ministries, schools, clinics and partners must work in step in order to address the massive impact of this pandemic to ensure that many more lives can be touched and saved,” says Mario Oliveira, director for emergency management at ADRA. Globally, more than 56 million people have contracted coronavirus and more than 1.3 million individuals have died, with the United States ranking as number one worldwide with more than 11 million confirmed cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University Numbers subject to change daily .

" Key messages A deadly mix of conflict, desert locust infestation, COVID 19 and climate change crisis have pushed more than 26 million people across six countries in East Africa into a hunger crisis. According to UN reports, approximately 509,000 people in East Africa are under catastrophic conditions, a phase marked by critical acute malnutrition, hunger, destitution and death – this phase is understood in the humanitarian sector as the highest and most urgent Integrated Food Insecurity Phase Classification IPC of level 5. Additionally, almost 7.2 million people are exposed to emergency phase IPC 4 . The region has endured substantial and widespread breeding of desert locusts since late 2019, resulting in loss of pasture and crops. Additionally, between June to date rising conflict in Ethiopia and portracted instability in Sudan and Somalia has exacerbated the food insecurity situation in the region. The Climate Prediction and Application Centre and the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation had both made predictions of dry conditions and a worsening food insecurity situation in 2021. Coupled with the economic impact of COVID 19 lockdowns, which continue to destroy livelihoods and push millions into desperation. FEWS NET analysis indicated dipped harvests which affected local supplies and food prices. This challenging period could erode human and economic development gains that have been made towards the global Sustainable Development Goals across the region. The rising food insecurity also increases the risks faced by women and girls, including gender based violence and sexual exploitation and abuse.","['Drought', 'Epidemic', 'Insect Infestation', 'Other']"

"SG SM 19329 ENV DEV 1901 OBV 1836 Following is UN Secretary General António Guterres’ message for World Tsunami Awareness Day, observed today Tsunamis are rare but devastating. I saw this first hand during my recent visit to Sulawesi, Indonesia, shortly after the earthquake and tsunami of 1 October. More than 2,000 people died and thousands more were harmed or displaced. As well as struggling to deal with the losses and trauma, the people of Sulawesi will need to recover from the economic losses caused by this disaster. Reducing economic losses is a key target of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and is vital for eradicating extreme poverty. Over the past two decades, tsunamis have accounted for almost 10 per cent of economic losses from disasters, setting back development gains, especially in countries that border the Indian and Pacific Oceans. World Tsunami Awareness Day is an opportunity to emphasize again the importance of disaster prevention and preparedness, including early warning, public education, science to better understand and predict tsunamis, and development that takes account of risk in seismic zones and exposed coastal areas.

" SITUATION AT A GLANCE 14.6 MILLION Estimated Population in Need of Humanitarian Assistance in Syria UN – Feb 2022 12 MILLION Estimated Food Insecure Population in Syria UN – Feb 2022 6.9 MILLION Estimated Number of IDPs in Syria UN – Feb 2022 5.5 MILLION Estimated People USAID BHA Reaches per Month in Syria USAID BHA – Dec 2021 2.1 MILLION Estimated People State PRM Reaches per Month in Syria State PRM – Sept 2021 The 2022 HNO for Syria identifies 14.6 million people in need of humanitarian assistance countrywide, representing an increase of 1.2 million people compared to 2021. As of mid February, the majority of those displaced by the late January ISIS attack on a northeast Syria prison—up to 45,000 people—had returned to their homes, while approximately 100 people continued to shelter at an Al Hasakah city collective center. Nearly 1.8 million COVAX supplied COVID 19 vaccines arrived in Syria on February 20. As of late February, approximately 11 percent of Syria’s population had received at least one vaccine dose. KEY DEVELOPMENTS 2022 Syria HNO Identifies 14.6 Million Syrians in Need of Aid In late February, the UN released the 2022 Humanitarian Needs Overview HNO for Syria, identifying 14.6 million people in need of humanitarian assistance countrywide, including approximately 5 million people classified as experiencing extreme or catastrophic levels of humanitarian need. The 2022 HNO reflects an additional 1.2 million people in need—or 9 percent increase—compared to the 13.4 million people in need of assistance in 2021, largely due to accelerated economic deterioration, climatic shocks adversely affecting water access, continued hostilities, forced displacement, limited access to basic commodities and services, and a lack of livelihood opportunities. The UN notes that the Syrian economy has severely worsened since the onset of the conflict in 2011, with the depreciation of the Syrian pound rising prices of food, fuel, and other essential items reduced household purchasing power and other factors exacerbating humanitarian needs countrywide. Economic deterioration has also created humanitarian needs among households who were historically less affected by hostilities and displacement. In addition, the UN identifies Syria as one of the countries in the Middle East most severely affected by the coronavirus disease COVID 19 pandemic, particularly as vaccine hesitancy, infections among frontline health workers, high transmission rates in internally displaced person IDP camps, oxygen supply shortages, inadequate testing materials, and limited cold chain and technical capacity hamper infection prevention, monitoring, and response efforts. Syrian households most frequently cited food and nutrition assistance—71 percent—and livelihood support—56 percent—as their priority needs in 2022. Food security actors estimate that 12 million people countrywide are experiencing acute food insecurity, while 1.9 million additional people are at risk of becoming food insecure. Additionally, 5.5 million children ages five years and younger and pregnant and lactating women are expected to require nutrition interventions during the year. Overall, the governorates with the highest number of people in need of aid in 2022 include Aleppo, with 2.7 million people Idlib, with 2.7 million and Rif Damascus, with 2.4 million. Idlib experienced the greatest increase in the number of people in need compared to 2021—nearly 50 percent—and has the largest population in extreme and catastrophic need of assistance at 2.3 million people. Most IDPs Displaced by Prison Attack, Subsequent Violence Return Home Security conditions in Al Hasakah Governorate’s Al Hasakah city remain stable following the January 20 attack on the Al Sina’a prison and subsequent clashes between Syrian Democratic Forces SDF and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ISIS actors. As of February 8, approximately 90 percent of the up to 45,000 individuals displaced during the conflict had returned to their homes in southern Al Hasakah city. Meanwhile, only one temporary collective center hosting communities affected by the recent attack remained open, with 100 people sheltering at the facility as of early February. The primary obstacles hindering the remaining IDPs’ return include damage or destruction of residences, shortages of basic commodities and services, and isolated movement restrictions associated with ongoing security operations, the UN reports. On February 2, Self Administration of North and East Syria authorities conducted an assessment in southern Al Hasakah city’s Ghweiran neighborhood to identify the scale of damage to public and private infrastructure. The assessment results classified 20 houses and several public buildings—including agricultural silos, a bakery, university classrooms, and a vocational training center—as destroyed. Relief actors, including the UN and USAID BHA partners, continue to provide food, health, nutrition, protection, and water, sanitation, and hygiene WASH services to affected populations across Al Hasakah city.","['Cold Wave', 'Epidemic']"

" After the earthquake, families in Chardonnières are barely recovering. By Molière Adely Six months after the earthquake that shook Haiti on 14 August 2021 – killing nearly 2,200 people, injuring 12,700, and affecting about half a million children – UNICEF continues to help families, and especially children, who were the main victims. In Chardonnières, with UNICEF’s support, dozens of families are receiving training in health and nutrition to improve the care they can offer their children. Chardonnières, Haiti, 14 February 2022 At only nine months old, Syndia Célestin experienced the greatest pain her mother died after fighting for her life for several months. The earthquake on 14 August 2021 found her bedridden in her mother's house in Chardonnières unable to move to seek shelter. Debris fell on her legs and her health worsened despite receiving medical attention. Her newborn daughter needed urgent help to survive. Her grandmother, Vita Lubin, 53, welcomed her into her home to provide her with food, a home, and a loving embrace. The girl's mother was ill for months before she died at the end of December. I took her to several hospitals. I sold almost everything I had to get the money to support her medical treatment. Unfortunately, we couldn't save her, says Vita, sitting on the terrace of her house, visibly damaged by the earthquake, as desolation infuses her story. In addition to being motherless, Syndia Célestin suffers from severe acute malnutrition. Despite her best efforts, Vita lacks the resources necessary to meet her granddaughter’s food and care needs. I give her food whenever I can. Some days I just give her bread and peanut butter, but that's not enough, she regrets. Her job as a food vendor is not enough to make ends meet, and her savings disappeared between the earthquake and her daughter’s illness. She now lives in a poor neighborhood in Chardonnières with the baby and other family members. As in the rest of the communes in southern Haiti, the earthquake destroyed or damaged a large part of the houses and buildings in Chardonnières. Many families were left homeless – facing uncertainty, food shortage and a lack of access to the most basic services, including drinking water. Changing Habits and Child Malnutrition on the Rise Eveline Dominique Chery, a health officer for UNICEF in Les Cayes, believes that the earthquake completely changed the lives of the inhabitants of Haiti's southern coast. Families were forced to change their diet It became very difficult for people to access the food they were used to consuming. Some families even reduced the number of daily meals they gave their children others changed the way they cooked. All this had a very strong impact on the nutrition of children in Chardonnières, she explains. Six months later, the situation has hardly changed. UNICEF estimates that nearly half a million children have been affected by the earthquake, with little or no access to shelter, drinking water, medical care, and nutrition. The global acute malnutrition rate at the national level is 6 . In the south it’s 4.7 , but this figure is likely to have increased after the earthquake, says Eveline. The Communion of Mothers Odena Michel, 46, is a mother of two children and a volunteer collaborator Col vol at the Parenting Club in Bousquette – a village in Chardonnières – which meets once a month in a church. In 2011, I started training mothers and organized several groups. I prepare hygiene and nutrition training activities, cooking demonstrations, and I also examine the girls and boys in the club, explains Odena, who was trained as a community health worker. Vita Lubin is one of the club members, and a committed grandmother who attends the club meetings regularly to improve the present and future life of her granddaughter, Syndia Célestin. Mantoute Marie Rolande is a nurse at the Sainte Anne Health Center in Chardonnières, and one of the people who manages the nutrition and vaccination services for children. These last few months, we have detected malnutrition in more than ten children, she says. On 1 February 2022, she welcomed Syndia Célestin to the hospital, who had a health check up for the first time since birth. After examining her, Mantoute provided the baby with several doses of vaccines and gave her grandmother Plumpy'Nut to continue feeding her at home. Plumpy'Nut is a peanut paste based ready to use therapeutic food that is easy to administer for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition. The Parenting Club had discontinued its activities after the earthquake, but slowly resumed the meetings. The goal is to mobilize women to improve the nutritional situation of children in the area. Thanks to the Parenting Club, in recent years there have been fewer malnourished children in the area, says Col vol Odena. There are currently 179 clubs operating in the Great South region, and, although these groups have been around for years, they are proliferating thanks to UNICEF’s support to the Ministry of Health. UNICEF, through the Integrated Health Services for Adolescents and Women project SSIAF , has cooperated with the Ministry in the training of the ASCPs Multi skilled Community Health Workers . It also helps us with the clubs, supporting the activities that the mothers organize each month, says Céline Percy Élysée, Child Health Coordinator of the Southern Health Department. The SSIAF project is funded by Canada and implemented by UNFPA, UNAIDS, PAHO, WHO, and UNICEF. Wilnèse Mogène, 31, lives with her daughter in Lapas 2, a village in Chardonnières. In 2016, she was invited by Odena to join the club. Thanks to the Parenting Club, I've learned a lot of things. They taught me the principles of hygiene and nutrition. I've learned how to balance what you eat at home, she says. The training she received in the club enabled her to feed her 10 year old daughter better. In the past, my daughter often had headaches. She couldn't understand what she was studying. Since I started serving her balanced meals, she no longer gets headaches. Now she studies well and remembers all the lessons, Wilnèse says. Her daughter, Wiltana Beaudier St Cyr, a fifth grader, lives with her, but was on vacation at her father's when the earth shook on 14 August. I immediately thought of my mother. I was afraid, Wiltana recalls. She says she is always afraid when there are earthquakes, as she knows that when the earth shakes, she could be one of the victims. This underlying fear, however, does not prevent her from dreaming about her future When I grow up, I want to be a nurse so I can care for the sick. Since the earthquake, UNICEF and the Ministry of health has tested 21,800 children under five for acute malnutrition. Over 1,100 children among them were treated for acute malnutrition and 3,700 for moderate acute malnutrition. UNICEF prepositioned emergency nutritional supplies to care for 27,000 children suffering from acute malnutrition in the Nippes, South and Grand’Anse affected by the earthquake.",['Earthquake']
"SUVA, FIJI 17 January 2022 UNICEF Pacific is ready to work together with the Government of Tonga and its partners to ensure urgent life saving support is provided to families and children in the aftermath of the volcanic eruption and tsunami. “We are on standby to provide humanitarian support to the Government of Tonga and its people affected by the volcanic eruption and tsunami,” said UNICEF Pacific Representative, Jonathan Veitch. “UNICEF will work with the government, civil society organizations, and other development partners to ensure immediate response efforts on the ground, which includes providing clean water, and emergency health supplies for children and families affected.” Following weeks of volcanic activity emitting ash, the Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha’apai underwater volcano in Tonga erupted violently on January 15, with satellite imagery indicating a 5 km wide plume of ash, steam, and gas, rising approximately 20 km above the volcano. Within minutes, the volcanic eruption generated a 1.2 metre tsunami that crashed ashore in coastal areas of Tonga’s capital, Nuku’alofa. Tsunami warnings were also issued for Fiji, Samoa, Vanuatu, Australia, and New Zealand. The majority of the country has been impacted by a 1 2cm layer of volcanic ash, which is affecting water and food supplies, and negatively impacting air quality. In the coming days, access to clean water supply will be an immediate priority. Communication lines have been interrupted since January 15, making it difficult to get information on the extent of the damage. Once the needs are confirmed by the Government of Tonga, UNICEF is ready to transport its pre positioned emergency supplies from Fiji and Brisbane warehouses. These include essential water, sanitation, and hygiene WASH kits, water containers and buckets, water field test kits, tarpaulins, recreational kits, and tents, that can be immediately mobilized for distribution. With borders closed in Tonga due to the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic, UNICEF will work with the government and its partners on the ground to reach children and families with the support they urgently need.

A boatload of food and water is expected to depart Port Vila late on Wednesday, headed for the shattered island. Large parts of Tanna, which is home to around 24,000 people, remain cut off due to landslides and severe cyclone damage making many roads impassable.

"SITUATION On the morning of Tuesday the 3rd March 2020 six out of nine regional states namely Afar, Amhara, Oromia, Somali, Tigray and Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples’ as well as the administration city of Dire Dawa are affected by desert locust invasion. A total of 173 districts are affected, up from 56 in October 2019. The desert locust invasion if not controlled can cause large scale scale crop, pasture, and forest cover losses which worsening food and feed availability, especially in areas emerging from recurrent El nino induced drought. According to FAO, numerous immature swarms appeared in a large portion of the Somali region in Ethiopia between Jijiga, Gode and Warder . Desert locusts continue coming into Ethiopia from Somalia while cross border swarm movements with Kenya are ongoing. An increasing number of swarms have been moving towards the southwest to central and southern Oromia region while other swarms remained in the Ogaden of the Somali region. The locust swarms had extended as far south as the Ethiopia Kenya border Moyale and onwards near Konso and adjacent areas of eastern Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region SNNPR . It is noted that there are also significant cross border swarm movements. By the end of February, locust swarms had moved into the Ethiopian Rift Valley from the south and already reached Awassa and Nazareth. It is forecasted that swarm movements are likely to occur in Somalia, Oromia and parts of SNNP regions, and are expected to reach the central highlands. To make it worse, the swam movements will breed substantially due to cross border swarm movements into Ethiopia along the Somali and Kenya border, causing hopper bands to form. the problem is unprecedented. Current operations is underway in the Somali, Oromia and SNNPR by the Ethiopian government. The Ethiopian government Ministry of Agriculture has conducted aerial control operations and treated 22, 500 ha but the scale of the problem is unprecedented since so far, the locusts have only been intercepted in 1,033km2 . Control operation has been attempted and only 966 km2 by applying over 75 000 litres of pesticides mainly through aerial spraying. The control operations need to be scaled up, already, Ethiopia national Disaster Risk Management – Agriculture Task Force in collaboration with FAO and Ministry of Agriculture have initiated an assessment of the impact of the locust invasion in Ethiopia and findings would be shared mid March 2020.","['Drought', 'Insect Infestation']"
"OVERVIEW Natural hazards such as earthquakes, droughts, floods, wildfires, and extreme winter weather affect a range of countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia EMCA . In addition, rapid urban growth and environmental degradation in some countries have led to overcrowding and settlement in hazard prone areas. Protracted conflict and limited governmental disaster management capacity in many EMCA countries compound the risks associated with natural disasters. Recognizing the vulnerabilities present throughout the EMCA region, USAID’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance USAID OFDA supports disaster risk reduction DRR projects to save lives, alleviate suffering, and reduce the economic and social impact of disasters. Programs measure and analyze disaster risks to identify and then implement risk reduction solutions. USAID OFDA provides technical assistance and technology transfer to build communities’ and local governments’ capacity to prepare for and respond to disasters. USAID OFDA also supports activities such as seismic resistant shelter construction and hazard mapping. In FY 2012, USAID OFDA provided more than 3.7 million for DRR projects throughout the EMCA region, including programs that integrate DRR with disaster response.","['Cold Wave', 'Drought', 'Earthquake', 'Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Snow Avalanche', 'Wild Fire']"
"David O'Hare David O’Hare reports from Freetown in Sierra Leone where hundreds lost their lives in a massive landslide on 14 August. I wake up on my first morning in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, to the sound of torrential rain outside. I know that this sound must strike fear in people from Matome on the outskirts of Freetown. There was torrential rain right through the night and into the early morning of Monday 14 August when disaster struck their community. The steep hill on which their houses were built collapsed under the weight of the rain. The eye witnesses I spoke to describe hearing a loud rumble and seeing the earth and rocks “rushing down the slope like water”. One woman told me “It was like the end of the world”. One month on I am looking at that same hill and there is nothing left of the houses. They were either destroyed by huge rocks tearing through them or completely buried by the tonnes of mud that came down the hill. Hundreds of people lost their lives in a matter of minutes. Many were in bed as the disaster struck before 7am. The official estimate puts the number of dead at 500 which includes 122 children, but local people fear that many hundreds more bodies lie buried in the mud and will never be recovered. The survivors count themselves lucky to be alive but they have faced incredibly difficult challenges since the disaster and continue to face these every day. One father I met told me of his family’s miraculous escape. He had left the house early to check on his brother who lived further down the valley as the rain was so bad “The hill came down in two stages very close together,” he told me. “The first slide woke my wife and she grabbed our four children and ran. My wife and children turned left when they got outside and ran for the trees. Our neighbours turned right. The second slide wiped them out. My family was lucky to make it. My youngest daughter, who is only five years old, was injured by the falling debris – that’s how close it was.” The family have lost everything but at least they are alive. Many other families are still in mourning for lost loved ones. I met Fatu Kanu 50 who lost her husband in the landslide. She had been visiting her sick mother in the country and her three children were staying with relatives. Her house was completely destroyed and her husband killed. The first she heard of it was when she received a call from a friend. “My husband’s body hasn’t been recovered and I don’t think it ever will be,” she says. “I think about him every day. I don’t know what the future holds. We have lost everything and I am worried for my children.” The family are currently staying at one of the emergency camps set up by the government in the area where the disaster struck. Facilities are very basic. Fatu tells me it is cold and with many families staying together in large tents there is no privacy. The needs of the 7,300 survivors, both physical and psychological, are enormous. Trócaire has been responding at the scene of the disaster with food, hygiene kits and psycho social support. This support has been a lifeline for many as they struggle to come to terms with their grief. Other help that is being rolled out includes school kits – schoolbags, books, pens and other items that have been lost – so that children can return to school and support for people as they try to earn a living and get back to some kind of normality. It will be a long road to recovery for the people of Matome and 14 August 2017 is a date that will never be forgotten here.","['Flood', 'Mud Slide']"

" Following Flooding in East Africa, Welthungerhilfe is Providing 250,000 Euros for Emergency Assistance. Bonn Berlin, 2020 09 22. Particularly heavy rainfall has caused flooding in East Africa. Just in Ethiopia, Sudan, and South Sudan, around 2.5 million people have been left with no defence against the mass of water. More rainfall is predicted for the coming days. Due to the plague of locusts and the coronavirus pandemic, people's reserves have run out. Welthungerhilfe is providing an extra 250,000 euros to supply families in affected countries with the essentials. The situation is particularly dramatic in Ethiopia, where more than a million people have been affected “This is the worst flood in living memory. Some villages have been waiting over a week for food aid. Farmland and pastures have been destroyed, a lot of livestock has drowned,” explains Matthias Späth, Country Director for Ethiopia, the difficult situation. Matthias Späth, Country Director for Welthungerhilfe in Ethiopia and Somaliland, is available for interviews. “Drought, locusts, coronavirus, and now floods as well Terrible and extreme disasters are coming one after another. And it always affects the poorest and weakest, who already face ruin. People just don't have a chance to get out of crisis management mode.” People in Sudan are also experiencing a once in a century flood, and the Nile has reached unprecedented levels. Last week the government declared a three month state of emergency. The number of extreme weather events has doubled since the early 1990s. “We can see that the rain is increasingly starting too early, too late, not at all, or in great quantities, not just in East Africa, but also currently in the Sahel region and in South Asia. This has fatal consequences for farming and people's living conditions, which are already difficult,” says Bettina Iseli, Programme Director for Welthungerhilfe. “The weather has simply become unpredictable. The people worst affected by the extreme weather are those who bear least responsibility for climate change.” Welthungerhilfe is supporting affected people by providing drinking water, soap, hygiene kits, sleeping mats, protective tarpaulins, and mosquito nets.

" OVERVIEW • Countries in the Latin America and the Caribbean LAC region experience a range of natural hazards, including droughts, earthquakes, floods, forest fires, hurricanes, landslides, tsunamis, and volcanoes. El Niño and La Niña phenomena occur periodically, exacerbating the impacts of hydrometeorological events in the LAC region. Unplanned urban expansion, environmental and natural resource degradation, and land use management challenges also increase populations’ vulnerability and exposure to natural hazards. • USAID OFDA supports DRR programs in LAC to build resilience and improve emergency preparedness, mitigation, and response capacity at the local, national, and regional levels. USAID OFDA focuses on strategic, context specific programs designed to meet particular risk reduction needs in each country, with capacity building a consistent theme across DRR activities. • In FY 2017, USAID OFDA provided approximately 34.9 million to support DRR initiatives throughout the LAC region. USAID OFDA staff based in the regional office in Costa Rica and the field office in Haiti engaged directly with community members, national officials, and other stakeholders to prepare for, respond to, and lessen the effects of disasters.","['Drought', 'Earthquake', 'Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Storm Surge', 'Tropical Cyclone', 'Tsunami', 'Volcano', 'Wild Fire']"
" HIGHLIGHTS Ghana has confirmed the second highest number of COVID 19 cases in the West and Central Africa region, after Nigeria, and the fifth highest number of cases in the World Health Organization WHO Africa region. As the strain of the pandemic adds to existing risks, such as disease outbreaks, floods, earthquakes and spillover of armed violence from the Central Sahel, there is an urgent need to reinforce coordination mechanisms and community structures for preparedness and response. UNICEF's strategy in Ghana involves protecting children and their families from exposure to COVID 19, minimizing mortality and supporting the continuity of services while ensuring preparedness for potential humanitarian crises. UNICEF is requesting US 26.9 million to respond to the COVID 19 crisis and support emergency preparedness in Ghana in 2021.

The Greater Accra and Ashanti regions have been most severely affected. The suspension of learning in more than 42,000 schools across the country due to the pandemic has adversely affected some 9.2 million basic education students, 500,000 tertiary education students, 450,000 teachers and 1,500 teacher educators directly employed by the Government. School closures have also impacted 61 schools for children with disabilities, impacting over 7,600 vulnerable learners. Across the country, limited access to water, sanitation and hygiene WASH facilities is undermining effective infection prevention and control. More than half of the population of Ghana has not adopted effective handwashing with soap on a regular basis.12 Three basic schools in five lack a safe water supply, and two in five lack sanitation facilities. Health sector data show that about 25 per cent of health centres lack adequate water and sanitation facilities. The COVID 19 crisis led to a reduction in social service coverage and impacted nutrition treatment and prevention services delivered through health and school platforms. Rapid assessments conducted by UNICEF and partners indicate that violence and abuse at home may be on the rise in the context of the COVID 19 pandemic. Thirty two per cent of adolescents and young people reported having observed increased abusive behaviour within their families during the past two months, including financial abuse 34 per cent , emotional abuse 32 per cent , physical abuse 17 per cent , sexual abuse 10 per cent and mental psychological abuse 7 per cent . In addition, 32 per cent of respondents felt that caregivers treated them more harshly than before. Evidence also shows that there is a strong increase in child abuse cases and a decline in violence prevention programming 77 per cent decline in the Greater Accra and Ashanti regions. Beyond the health impacts of the pandemic, the socio economic impacts of COVID 19 are expected to be wide ranging in Ghana, and will pose a serious threat to poverty reduction and progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals. In 2019, 6.8 million Ghanaians were living in poverty, including 2.4 million Ghanaians who were extremely poor.16 Nearly three quarters of children in Ghana are deprived in three or more poverty dimensions for children under 5 years, this proportion is even higher at nearly 83 per cent.",['Epidemic']

" HIGHLIGHTS In Ethiopia, 19.2 million people, including 11.7 million children, 4 million women and 1.7 million persons with disabilities, urgently need humanitarian assistance.1 This is double the number of people in need in 2020 due to the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 , desert locust infestation and conflict displacement. In 2021, UNICEF will deliver life saving services to children and families and apply a targeted, multi sector systems strengthening approach through its partners and eight field offices, and using cash based solutions. UNICEF will address the specific needs of girls, boys, adolescents, women and men using a conflict sensitive approach, emphasizing accountability to affected populations and focusing on the prevention of gender based violence and sexual exploitation. UNICEF is appealing for US 188 million to reach children in Ethiopia with humanitarian assistance in 2020. This includes major funding requirements for water, sanitation and hygiene WASH , health, nutrition, education and child protection. HUMANITARIAN SITUATION AND NEEDS The humanitarian situation in Ethiopia is complex, with 19.2 million people currently in need of humanitarian assistance as of August 2020, up from 8.4 million in January 2020.6 This includes 11.7 million children, 4 million women and 1.7 million people with a disability.7 Additional needs have emanated from the socio economic impact of COVID 19 8 and the worst desert locust infestation in 25 years. Ethiopia remains vulnerable to other disease outbreaks, floods, conflict displacement and drought. The pandemic has threatened the gains made to children's well being, particularly due to its impact on poverty levels, the delivery of maternal, newborn, child, adolescent and youth health care and education and protection services. Given that women are primarily responsible for procuring and cooking food, rising economic and food insecurity places them at heightened risk of gender based violence. Yet support for survivors of gender based violence has been severely disrupted due to overburdened health systems grappling with COVID 19. The locust infestation has devastated livelihoods and directly impacted food security for millions of people.9 An extended rainy season has led to flooding that has destroyed livelihoods, services and road infrastructure and caused displacement. The National Flood Task Force estimates that by December 2020, over 2 million people will have been impacted by flooding, and over 500,000 people will be displaced. Ongoing insecurity, inter communal violence and military confrontations have also led to displacement and undermined humanitarian access. Some 1.8 million people, including 1.1 million children, are currently displaced.10 The return of more than 1.4 million internally displaced people 52 per cent of them women has further depleted community resources and increased humanitarian needs.11 In addition, 9.7 million people lack access to safe drinking water and sanitation 687,000 children are severely malnourished, with needs expected to rise 12 26 million children are affected by school closures and 2.4 million children require protection.13 Ethiopia hosts over 779,000 refugees,14 including 440,000 children.15 Children and women are extremely vulnerable to, and disproportionately impacted by, COVID19, other disease outbreaks, displacement and the loss of livelihoods. Refugees and internally displaced persons, particularly women and girls, will require protection from gender based violence and referral to services. The resources available to respond to the humanitarian needs in Ethiopia are insufficient. The limited number of partners,16 COVID 19 related operational restrictions, challenging topography, pockets of insecurity and access constraints are hampering the provision of humanitarian assistance.","['Drought', 'Epidemic', 'Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Insect Infestation']"
" Executive summary This paper explores the impacts that climate change will likely have on children in the Pacific, with particular focus on Kiribati and Vanuatu. It provides insights into how different actors in those two countries are currently considering children in their policies and programmes. Included is an outline of the possible directions for UNICEF in its pursuit of a children sensitive response to the multiple challenges that changing climate will bring. The paper builds on a growing body of climate change related studies of the Pacific Islands situation. It is the first paper to publically present climate change modelling together with a review of Pacific climate change adaptation plans to support the call for more child focused climate change actions. The paper also highlights the scarcity of child specific climate change studies from the Pacific. The results of the modelling created for this study indicate that both case study countries are projected to experience a slightly lower rise in their maximum temperature compared with the projected global average of 2.7°C . According to the modelling, maximum temperatures are projected to increase in Kiribati by 2.1°C and in Vanuatu by 1.9°C by 2050, relative to the 1961–1990 average. In comparison, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC has projected average temperatures of up to 2.48°C for the North Pacific and 1.79°C for the South Pacific by 2069 Mimura et al., 2007 .1 Unlike temperature, which has a reasonably uniform result across all models, the climate change projections for rainfall in the case study countries present a broad range of future scenarios, ranging from 2 per cent to an increase of 75 per cent by 2050 the median of the models shows a 2 per cent increase for Lamap, Vanuatu and a 26 per cent increase in Tarawa, Kiribati . The range of risks unfolding in both countries include increased health issues, decreased potable water availability, food security The IPCC projections for the Pacific were from seven general circulation models, whereas this study used an ensemble of 21. challenges, cyclone risks in Vanuatu and considerable coastal erosion. The climate change related issues confronting the Small Island Developing States SIDS , like Kiribati, are dominated by the projections of sea level rise because of the expected life changing impacts. Even low end projections will require considerable roll out of infrastructure solutions such as sea walls and water storage facilities as well as non engineering based responses psychosocial support . The high end sea level rise projections challenge the very existence of Kiribati. Under a best case scenario, it is more than likely that both Kiribati and Vanuatu will need to relocate some communities to less exposed areas, including international relocation. Without drastic global cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, it is likely that sea level rise will have direct such as loss of land and indirect psychological issues associated with forced relocation consequences for Kiribati due to the nation’s low lying nature. Although sea level rise does not threaten to completely submerge Vanuatu as it does in Kiribati , it still presents multiple challenges. These include forced relocations of low lying communities and increasing risks from storm surge when combined with cyclones . Currently, children have a limited role in adaptation actions in both countries, although there has been a recognizable shift in Kiribati policies towards including children in some adaptation discussions inclusion in the upcoming relocation discussions, for instance . In Kiribati, many children are helping to plant mangroves to help protect the coastline from increased wave action. In Vanuatu, children have been engaged in river clean up projects, which have been used also as an opportunity to increase environmental awareness and education. Both countries have active climate change youth groups engaged in international awareness raising activities. Kiribati and Vanuatu, like many SIDS in the Pacific, have had an expedited need to embrace adaptation. The degree of impact from climate change they experience will be determined by the rest of the international community’s ability and willingness to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The SIDS in the Pacific are geographically and economically vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, which are likely to emerge sooner rather than later. Without the luxury of time, rapid adaptation is a necessity, which in turn increases the likelihood of unanticipated consequences arising from climate change responses. Eighteen months has passed since the last UNICEF study of climate change impacts on children in the Pacific Urbano and Maclellan, 2010 , and it seems evident that little progress has emerged in relation to the consideration of children in climate change studies and policies. Greater emphasis and advocacy must be given to this situation. Considerable opportunities exist for child led and child focused responses to the effects of climate change. The following table presents a summary of possibilities that emerged through the research for this study.","['Drought', 'Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Severe Local Storm', 'Storm Surge', 'Tropical Cyclone', 'Tsunami', 'Volcano']"
" Summary United in Science provides an overview of the most recent science related to climate change, impacts and responses from the World Meteorological Organization WMO and partner organizations. At a time when urgent action to address climate change is needed, the report provides unified scientific information to inform decision makers and highlights some of the physical and socioeconomic impacts of the current and projected climate. According to the WMO Global Atmosphere Watch, atmospheric greenhouse gas GHG concentrations continue to rise, despite emissions reductions in 2020 resulting from the COVID 19 pandemic lockdowns. The Global Carbon Project also notes that, in 2021, global fossil CO2 emissions returned to 2019 pre pandemic levels after a large, but temporary, absolute drop in emissions due to widespread lockdowns. These conditions are leading to increasing global surface temperature and other climatic changes, as highlighted by the WMO State of the Global Climate 2021 report, which found the most recent seven years, 2015 to 2021, to be the warmest on record. Looking forward, the Met Office UK , in partnership with the World Climate Research Programme, found that there is a 48 chance that, during at least one year in the next five years, annual mean temperature will temporarily be 1.5 °C higher than in 1850 1900. Additionally, there is a 93 chance that at least one year in the same time period will be the hottest on record. The UN Environment Programme’s latest Emissions Gap Report found that the full implementation of mitigation pledges made by countries as of 4 November 2021 is insufficient and will not keep global warming below 1.5 °C above pre industrial levels. The report also found that the ambition of these pledges would need to be four times higher to keep global temperature rise below 2 °C above pre industrial levels and seven times higher to limit warming to 1.5 °C. Enhanced mitigation action is needed to prevent the goals of the Paris Agreement from slipping out of reach. Without ambitious action, the physical and socioeconomic impacts of climate change will be devastating. Irreversible physical changes in the climate system, known as tipping points, can not be ruleld out and could have significant global and regional consequences. According to the Urban Climate Change Research Network, cities – responsible for up to 70 of human caused emissions – will face increasing climate impacts that will intersect with socioeconomic inequalities. Additionally, the WMO World Weather Research Programme highlights that it is the world’s most vulnerable populations that will suffer the most, as has already been observed during recent extreme weather events. Billions of people around the world are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. As a result, adaptation and disaster risk reduction are crucial to lower the risks to climate impacts. According to WMO and the UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, early warning systems not only save lives and reduce losses and damages, but also contribute to disaster risk reduction, and support climate change adaptation. However, less than half of all countries in the world have these crucial systems and coverage is particuarly low in vulnerable countries. To address this issue, the United Nations SecretaryGeneral António Guterres called for new action to ensure every person on Earth is protected by early warning systems in the next five years. Additionally, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently released highly anticipated Working Group reports covering The Physical Science Basis Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability and Mitigation of Climate Change, which are an integral part of its Sixth Assessment Report. These important reports identify the strength of scientific agreement in these different areas as well as where further research is needed. The science is clear – urgent action is needed to mitigate emissions and adapt to our changing climate. The United Nations system, along with its partners, will continue to provide world leading science to inform decision making and support global climate action.","['Drought', 'Flood', 'Heat Wave', 'Tropical Cyclone', 'Wild Fire']"
"Marshall Islands foreign minister Tony de Brum failed to attend this week’s key climate change talks in Morroco due to climate change related storm that affected the Pacific nation. This week’s INDC Ministerial Forum in Morocco and next week’s final round of officials level negotiations in Bonn is to discuss a new international agreement on climate change, due to be adopted in Paris in mid December Climate pledges made by national governments ahead of COP21 fall short of meeting the international goal of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. Projections show the current pledges to curb greenhouse gas emissions would put world on a path toward 3 degrees Celsius. Marshall Islands foreign Minister Tony de Brum said locking in the current emissions targets would spell disaster. “While still mopping up US 4.2 million in damage from Typhoon Nangka, the Marshall Islands has been hit by yet another unseasonal storm fueled by climate change.” “In the last week alone, we have had chaotic swells, more than 150 millimeters of rain, as well as unprecedented gale force winds from the west. And this week we are expecting king tides that will reach almost 2 meters in height. My own home is under climate attack. A 40 foot boat that lost its mooring during the last storm dangles perilously close to our sea wall, threatening to smash down my family home. My children and grandchildren have been going to bed in fear.” “Sadly, the latest crisis sadly means I cannot join ministers in Rabat this week, but I hope they have my country firmly in mind when they look at how we’re tracking for the Paris Agreement. EU Climate Commissioner Miguel Cañete and Moroccan Minister Hakima El Haite have shown real leadership in convening this meeting, but we all know the inescapable reality – we have a severe crisis of ambition. The proposed targets on the table for Paris have us on track to at least 2.7˚C of warming by the end of the century – this is three times the warming we have now. Without much more urgent and ambitious action, my country simply won’t survive,” de brum said in a statement. “The first step to dealing with a crisis is to acknowledge it the second step is to have a strategy to overcome it. If we lock in the current targets all the way through to 2030, we will have failed. The Paris Agreement must be ‘designed for ambition’ by kicking off with a political moment in 2020 to deepen targets in pursuit of a long term decarbonization pathway that can limit warming to below 1.5˚C. It must also deliver the climate finance to support the transition to the new low carbon and climate resilient economy, and tackle seriously the longer term impacts and security threats we will inevitably face.” “Next week’s talks in Bonn are the last chance for our negotiators to sow the seeds of success for Paris. I have read the latest text and see some important gaps. But if we don’t move forward now, we risk no agreement in Paris. We will be working hard with our friends and partners to produce a text that is simple, strong and that puts a safe future ahead of short sighted politics. As this week’s events in my country show, failure is not an option, said de Brum. SOURCE PACNEWS.",['Severe Local Storm']

"Climate change has the potential to exacerbate existing incompliance with economic, social and cultural rights because many countries that are most vulnerable to climate change are ones with weak human rights mechanisms. p Although poor countries are disproportionately feeling the adverse impacts of climate change, however, wealthy countries the historical CO2 emitters are dragging their feet on committing to a legally binding solution, an inaction that led Bolivia's ambassador to the UN to say that wealthy states are quot holding humanity hostage. quot As countries gather this week for the 2010 UN Climate Change Conference, will Cancun deliver what Copenhagen couldn't? Bringing human rights to into the discussion might help to bring climate justice to the center of negotiations. p For many people, climate change seems like a looming but distant problem, an intangible concept removed from our day to day living and relegated to scientific statistics and future concerns. For many communities around the world, however, climate change is already having devastating human impacts it is a crisis of today just as much as it is one of tomorrow. What is certain is that ultimately, climate change will affect us all, and even small changes in global temperatures and weather patterns can have huge and irreversible impacts. p Symptoms that we are reaching a breaking point have been already evidenced in several devastating natural disasters in recent years, such as, for instance, the floods in Pakistan earlier this year. Around 14 million people were affected by the flooding there, a disaster greater in scale than the South Asian tsunami and the recent earthquakes in Haiti combined. Evidence shows that the frequency of if these sudden onset disasters is increasing, with an average of about 400 disasters per year, double the figure reported 20 years ago. p These disasters result in high death tolls which disproportionately are felt by vulnerable groups such as women and children, indigenous groups, refugees, the disabled and the poor. They often lead to secondary negative impacts which further exacerbate the enjoyment of human rights including food crises, displacement and lack of access to adequate sanitation, education and health facilities. p Climate change impacts, however, are not always so obvious, and some of the most challenging consequences have been or are slowly encroaching. We have all heard the foreboding predictions on the climate change induced displacement that would occur should global sea levels rise even marginally. A new report by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research shows that up to a billion people could be made homeless in the next 90 years if countries fail to cut emissions. Many small island nations' very right to self determination is threatened by rising sea levels, such as Kiribati, which recently hosted the latest conference of the Climate Vulnerable Forum. p Each year, many countries find themselves more and more water scarce and prone to desertification, leading to droughts which have pushed people on the brink of starvation, notably in landlocked Niger, where 46 percent of the population suffer from food insecurity. In June 2010, Russia, the world's third largest polluter after China and the United States, experienced an anomalous heat wave that resulted in many fatalities and wildfires around the country. Figures by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA suggest that 2010 is most likely to be the warmest year since records began in 1880. p Climate change is slowly melting glaciers and the ice caps, often presented through the image of desolate polar bears floating on broken off ice islands. However, these changes to Arctic regions are also threatening the traditional way of life of indigenous peoples. An Inuit petition was famously filed in 2005 to the Inter American Commission on Human Rights against the United States, claiming that the US had violated human rights by damaging the livelihoods of the Arctic peoples by failing to curb its emissions. p Climate change is already and will continue to have distressing and multiple negative impacts, posing an existential threat to humankind, making combating it a quot a moral imperative. quot This has been acknowledged by the UN OHCHR in its Resolution 7 23 on Human Rights and Climate Change March 28, 2008 , which raised concern that climate change quot poses an immediate and far reaching threat. quot The world's nations cannot afford to waste time delivering on their pledges made in Copenhagen last year to reduce emissions to keep global temperatures under a two degrees Celsius rise. The Kyoto Protocol aimed to reduce greenhouse gases by five percent by 2012 from 1990 levels. However, in 2009, greenhouse gas emissions were 40 percent greater than they were in 1990. p Unfortunately, those who have contributed the least to climate change emissions and have the least resources and access to information to cope with and understand its effects often find themselves on the frontline of feeling climate change's adverse impacts. Even more disconcerting, several countries continue to operate under a quot business as usual quot scenario and up until recently, even evidence of global warming was disputed. The OHCHR A HRC 10 61 of January 15, 2009 in a recent study on the links between climate change and human rights outlines policy guidelines and stresses international obligations of states with regard to international in this context. p The OHCHR has also affirmed that human rights standards and principles should form the basis for and strengthen policymaking in the area of climate change and countries are called to align climate change policies with human rights objectives. CESR participated in the 3rd UN Social Forum on the adverse impact of climate change on the fulfillment of human rights, including ESC rights, that was hosted in Geneva from October 4 6, 2010. p World leaders are urged to incorporate international human rights principles into the Cancun negotiations. Despite already low expectations for Cancun, it is critical that a binding commitment be reached on emissions reduction to keep temperature below the tipping point of 2 degrees Celsius. Wealthy countries should acknowledge their quot differentiated responsibility quot in global climate change adaptation and mitigation in order to comply with their extra territorial obligations to respect, protect and fulfill economic, social and cultural rights. p Posted by Victoria Wisniewski Otero on November 30th, 2010.","['Flood', 'Wild Fire']"

" Welthungerhilfe Presents its 2020 Annual Report Famines are on the increase. Bonn Berlin, 2021 06 30. At its annual press conference, Welthungerhilfe is concerned to observe that famines have returned in crisis areas. According to current UN figures, 41 million people around the world are living on the edge of famine, and risk starvation if they do not get swift survival aid. Armed conflicts, such as those in the crisis region of Tigray in northern Ethiopia, and droughts lasting years, such as the drought in southern Madagascar, have devastating consequences especially for the poorest families. “In many of our project countries, the pandemic has dramatically worsened conditions for people. The coronavirus has mutated into a virus of hunger, and women and children in particular are suffering most as a result. Girls are being married off young, and many children are not going back to school because they have to earn money. Climate change poses an existential threat to families in Africa. In Madagascar there have been droughts, and in East Africa massive floods have destroyed farmland and herds of cattle, and with them the livelihoods of smallholders. People have no reserves left”, warns Marlehn Thieme, President of Welthungerhilfe. But the review of the last year also shows how much could be achieved, despite all the difficulties. The German public showed an extremely high level of solidarity and willingness to help in 2020. Welthungerhilfe received one of the highest amounts of donations in its history and was able to support more than 14 million people. “Private donations are an important stimulus for us to press on with the fight against hunger and poverty. Current reports from the countries where we work are alarming. Food prices are rising steeply, economic development has been set back years because of the lockdowns and interruptions in trade routes, and many families have run up serious debt. In many countries, people are battling the effects of several overlapping crises, and hunger is increasingly being used as a weapon in war zones”, stresses Mathias Mogge, Secretary General of Welthungerhilfe. In 2020 Welthungerhilfe had 285.4 million euros to spend on the fight against hunger and poverty. 69.6 million euros came from private donations received. Public donors provided 213.2 million euros for project work. The proportion coming from the German Federal Government was almost 50 percent, the largest individual donor being the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development BMZ , which provided 43.8 million euros. South Sudan, Sudan, and Syria Turkey received the largest amount of project support, like last year.

" p br SITUATION UPDATE p p The winter season is nearing its end. There is a clear trend of rising temperatures after what has been an uncharacteristically cold winter for Swaziland. p p There has been notable progress in the emergency response in several areas. The Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives and FAO have accelerated distribution of seeds and agricultural tools. The distribution has been finalized in six constituencies, benefiting 11,695 households, and will be completed in time for the planting season in October. p p Stakeholders are also making concerted efforts in monitoring the water situation in affected regions and improving the response to these findings. To date, the Water Crisis Committee has drilled 23 boreholes and rehabilitated 16 water infrastructures in three constituencies. Despite the acute water shortage in the low veldt, available data did not show an upsurge of diarrhoeal diseases. Reports of cholera cases appeared in a local newspaper last week. However, these reports are not supported by clinical findings from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. p p UNICEF RESPONSE p p class c2 Health and Nutrition WASH p p Nutrition sentinel surveillance entered its fifth week.

Pigg's Peak Hospital in northern Hhohho and RFM Hospital in Manzini, will begin providing therapeutic feeding this week. p In collaboration with Swaziland Water Services Cooperation SWSC , water from each of the five hospitals serving as TFCs was tested in preparation for therapeutic feeding. The water supply in all five TFCs is generally sufficient. Water quality was also acceptable in all sites except Hlatikhulu Hospital and Good Shepherd Hospital. Good Shepherd is often forced to source water from a spring as the water supply from SWSC is not reliable. To improve water quality at Good Shepherd, the spring will be decommissioned and the current service reservoir will be emptied for cleaning. Water will be trucked to the Hospital as a substitute supply while the spring source is brought up to acceptable quality. UNICEF is working with SWSC to address the needs at Hlatikhulu hospital to ensure a safe water supply. p p The training of up to 200 health workers as well as the establishment of six more TFC sites is in progress. p p To improve monitoring and reporting, the Swaziland National Nutrition Council SNNC recently trained 120 health workers participating in nutrition surveillance and established regional nutrition focal persons. With support from UNICEF, SNNC is now drafting a national nutrition policy for the country. p p class c2 Child Protection p p Sixty survival kits for forest fire victims were handed over to Swaziland Red Cross on 4 September 2007, bringing the total number of UNICEF donated kits to 150.

"South Africa will provide tons of maize meal to the people of Zimbabwe who were affected by severe flooding caused by the tropical cyclone Idai weather system in 2019. According to the Department of International Relations and Cooperation DIRCO , Minister Naledi Pandor will travel to Zimbabwe on Africa Day, 25 May 2021, to officially hand over the first shipment. “His Excellency, the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Emmerson Mnangagwa will receive the consignment on behalf of the people of Zimbabwe at the State House in Harare, Zimbabwe,” the department said. The department said South Africa responded to an appeal from the Zimbabwean government in 2019 for humanitarian assistance. DIRCO said this was in response to infrastructure destruction and loss of human life caused by severe flooding. According to ReliefWeb, the largest humanitarian information portal in the world, at least 82 deaths and over 200 injuries were reported, mainly in Chimanimani, while 217 people went missing. Through the African Renaissance and International Cooperation Fund ARF , the department said South Africa pledged R50 million in humanitarian support to assist those affected by the cyclone in Zimbabwe. The assistance consists 450 000 bags of 12.5 kg maize meal to be distributed to the affected families. “The outbreak of the COVID 19 delayed the implementation of the project, which will now be completed by September 2021.”.","['Epidemic', 'Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Tropical Cyclone']"
"The most powerful typhoon ever to strike South Korea claimed more than 100 lives and left 25,000 homeless when it roared ashore over the weekend, leveling buildings, tossing giant cranes and triggering widespread flooding. br Typhoon Maemi, or quot cicada quot in Korean, tore into southern portions of the peninsula Friday night Sept. 12 with record winds of 134 mph that demolished everything in its path before heading out to sea Saturday. p Thousands of rescue workers and soldiers were searching for at least 24 people listed as missing and helping to repair downed electric and telephone poles and washed out roads. In the southern city of Masan, rescue teams tried for days to reach a dozen people trapped in the basement of a collapsed karaoke bar. Eight bodies have been found so far. p quot The death toll is likely to rise further as the rescue teams still report dead bodies floating on the rivers and the oceans, quot Shin Sang yong, an official at the council told Reuters. p Image Courtesy of the BBC The South Korea's main port city of Pusan is already reporting tens of millions of dollars in damages, including a massive cruise ship that tidal waves tossed onto a popular beach. Local television footage also showed giant container cranes twisted into pretzel shapes, a row of shredded seaside shops, overturned cars floating down streets turned into rivers and buckled roads and bridges, according to Reuters. p quot The typhoon landed when the tide was full, causing even bigger damages, quot Choi Myong sun, a fisherman, told local television. quot The typhoon was so strong that our preventive steps were not useful at all. quot p At least 82 vessels sank amid the monstrous ocean swells and 1.4 million homes lost power when operations at five nuclear power plants halted during the typhoon. Services were scheduled for restoration on Monday. p More than 17 inches of rain fell in some parts of South Korea and flood warnings were issued across central and southern portions of the country. A government statement released Sunday said that the typhoon damaged 774 roads, 27 bridges, and submerged 43,027 acres of farmland, resulting in more than 1.4 billion in damages. p Typhoon Maemi had weakened by Sunday into a tropical depression, causing only minor damage on the island of Hokkaido as it dissipated. p South Korea is usually hit by several typhoons each summer and early fall.

"Over the last months, the corona pandemic has affected the lives of billions of people around the globe. The virus has challenged the most established and well funded health and social protection systems, but poses even greater risks for regions and states that lack such services. The virus has irreversibly exposed and exacerbated existing global inequalities. Vulnerable individuals and groups – including elderly, poor, women, and refugees – are disproportionately affected. They often face more health risks, depend on a day to day income for survival, or are unable to carry out social distancing practices. As a result, more and more people are facing precarious situations with unstable incomes and serious food insecurity. From the first stages of the corona outbreak, ICCO Cooperation has provided support to severely affected populations. Our activities include medical aid, awareness raising, and economic empowerment, which aim to prevent and slow down transmission. In most countries help is offered through local partners. Not only does this ensure a quick and efficient response, but it also allows for a context specific approach that is respectful of local culture, habits and social norms. Some of the COVID 19 activities that ICCO and partners have implemented in different countries are highlighted below. Ethiopia, Sudan and Central African Republic Besides increasing infection rates of the coronavirus, the Horn of Africa is currently also suffering from large swarms of desert locusts. This locust upsurge has resulted in harvest loss and growing numbers of internally displaced people throughout the region. In cooperation with our local partners EECMY and Hundee, ICCO offers emergency relief to recover food security in Ethiopia, while also integrating COVID 19 prevention strategies. In Sudan, Central African Republic and Ethiopia, hand dug wells are repaired and rehabilitated, washing stations are placed, and soap bars are distributed to enhance personal hygiene. Both in Ethiopia and Sudan, campaigns have been set up to raise awareness about the virus. Local radio channels have allowed ICCO’s partners to use airtime for broadcasting information about transmission and self care methods to prevent COVID 19. These campaigns will ensure that even the most hard to reach individuals, including people with disabilities, women, the elderly, and illiterate people, receive hygiene promotion information. Bolivia and Colombia Besides health activities, the COVID 19 pandemic also requires creative solutions to address the economic dimension of the crisis. In South America, disadvantaged young adults are being trained in Manq’a cooking schools to become chefs. However, due to the corona situation and its related restrictions, their small enterprises are hardly surviving and suffering financial losses. In Bolivia, ICCO is supporting these students to keep their businesses running, and is offering them online opportunities to continue their education. In June, 2,500 meals prepared by Manq’a students were distributed to people who have become food insecure during the corona crisis, including elderly, migrants and people with disabilities. In addition, some 400 highly nutritional lunch meals were cooked for the brave doctors and nurses battling the coronavirus. Bangladesh In Bangladesh, ICCO is supporting poor farming households whose food insecurity has reached alarming levels during the corona crisis. Due to the pandemic, the government has imposed travel restrictions, disallowing transportation of products and goods to local markets. However, many rural farmers in Bangladesh are heavily dependent on their agricultural yields, as well as on other day to day labor opportunities in nearby villages. Looking at the longer term, the farmers’ economic losses will pressurize food insecurity across the entire country. In order to mitigate the impacts of the coronavirus in Bangladesh, ICCO has reallocated some of its budget to be able to support some 5,000 farmers and their households. Agri inputs such as seeds and fertilizers are provided to individuals and families most in need to secure their incomes for the next season. In addition, activities and trainings are being organized to raise awareness about the virus and to strengthen agricultural skills. Most recently, the farmers received agri inputs to cultivate salt tolerant crops. These are more suitable to the Bangladeshi environment and therefore enhance food security. Through all these activities, the farmers will become more resilient to future shocks. Nepal Numbers of COVID 19 infected cases in Nepal keep rising as thousands of Nepalese migrants return to the country. The national health system is falling short on capacities. Therefore, ICCO has diverted some funding reserved for disaster awareness to support the Nepal Army’s quarantine station. With this help, new mattresses, pillows, blankets, bedsheets, and mosquito nets have been purchased, enabling the station to host more people in quarantine. This way, more people can enjoy a safe place for self quarantine, hence preventing further spread of the virus. These are some examples of recent COVID 19 related activities. However, ICCO and our partners are battling the coronavirus in many other contexts around the globe.

The livelihood program is funded by various donors such as Aktion Deutschland Hilft ADH in Germany, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ministere des Affaires Etrangeresor MAE in Luxemburg, H M Conscious Foundation in Netherlands, French Ministry of Foreign Affairs MoFA , Disaster Emergency Committee DEC , Global Affairs Canada previously DFATD , Foundation of Dutch Cooperating Aid Organizations SHO , European Commission Humanitarian Aid ECHO , funds from the people of Austria, Australia, Germany, UK, and the USA, and from private foundations such as InterContinental Hotels Group IHG and French private companies. The objectives of the Final Evaluation as per Terms of Reference ToR are the following 1. Assess the overall achievement of results of the response program based on the logframe and focusing on the livelihoods recovery component, specifically pointing to evidence that the program was able to contribute to positive changes in communities’ lives. 2. Evaluate program performance under the four major themes – program delivery model, integration of gender equality and disaster risk reduction DRR , partnership strategy, and accountability principles and practices. The four main evaluation criteria used are effectiveness, efficiency, impact, and sustainability. 3. Identify lessons learned, good practices and any particular challenges in the implementation of the program and achievement of results 4. Provide recommendations to improve future programming. The Evaluation employed the combination of utilization focused and participatory approaches in the collection and analysis of results. The latter was realized through the involvement of a substantive sample of stakeholders for the livelihoods component in surveys, focus group discussions FGDs , and key informant interviews KIIs . Overall Achievements of Results The following are the output achievements of the Program 27,415 men and women who have used cash grants to jump start quick impact livelihoods and attended income generating activity IGA planning and money management orientation. Top five livelihoods that beneficiaries embarked on were rearing pig and chicken, sari sari retail store, retail trading various types , and tied to fifth place are vegetable farming and food vending. 25,330 men and women who received additional cash grants to expand and diversify livelihoods 284 community enterprises accessed livelihood support funds covering 16 types of commodities rice, cassava, other rootcrops, abaca, tikog, other materials for handicraft, herbs, vegetable, vermicompost, seaweeds, ginger, banana, native chicken, aqua marine, other agri crops, others at four stages of the value chain input supply, production, processing, and marketing, including logistics transport 38,566 men and women participated in community enterprise projects 912 women’s enterprises expanded and diversified. Majority of the beneficiaries are engaged in food vending. The rest are in agriculture agricultural crop, marine aquaculture, poultry livestock , handicraft, textile products, and services. 39,478 men and women engaged in community and women owned enterprises participated in trainings such as community based enterprise development C BED , gender, disaster risk reduction, and business planning The livelihood component has contributed to the achievement of Program objectives. The financial assistance, complemented by capacity building and technical assistance, has increased the capacity of men and women to implement profitable and sustainable enterprises. Survey in December 2016 showed that a little over half of beneficiaries 55 were even able to diversify their respective livelihoods. For women entrepreneurs in particular, 80 have increased confidence in managing their respective enterprises compared to 31.5 in June 2016. Women played a substantial role in the strategic business decision making process. Moreover, 80 were able to establish market linkages. The types of markets are walk in buyers 21 , retailers 6 , wholesalers 4 , institutional buyers 1 , and various multiple 55 . Market transactions are primarily happening at the barangay level 31 . Households implementing the three tracks of livelihood support have earned income 73 of household cash transfer beneficiaries earned income with a monthly net average of Php 2,785.15 compared to the previous Php 2,000 per month 100 of women enterprise beneficiaries with a monthly net average of Php 4,382.09 compared to Php 412 before and 36 of households participating in community enterprises with monthly net average of Php 42,050 compared to Php 40,850 before. From their income, beneficiaries were able to acquire household assets such as appliances and electronic gadgets 52 , furniture and fixtures 18 , and motorcycle 30 . They were also able to acquire productive assets 63 own small livestock, 53 farm equipment non mechanized , 5 farm equipment mechanized , and tools 49 . Acquisition of assets was made possible either through the financial grant or income from CARE assisted enterprises. Three years after typhoon Haiyan, affected communities are on their way to recovery and resilience as shown by the following Households were able to meet or attain basic needs such as food 95 and education 97 compared to the pre typhoon levels. On the other hand, health 93 and shelter 88 were partially improved met while debt payment 48 and savings 81 are not improved or not yet met. Use of negative coping mechanisms was reduced. The percentage of people employing each of the nine negative coping mechanisms was reduced after the introduction of CARE’s program. As CARE was the major implementer of livelihoods in each Barangay, it is reasonable to assume that CARE’s intervention contributed to this reduction. Much fewer people are modifying food consumption of the households such as limiting meal portions, purchasing less preferred items, reducing number of meals eaten in a day, and borrowing food from others. Likewise, there has also been reduction in the use of nonfood negative coping mechanisms such as decreasing health education incomegenerating expenditures. Very few respondents used erosive coping mechanisms such as sale of assets or sending family members away to work. Households were able to employ livelihood protection mechanisms through cash transfers by CARE shelter and livelihoods , and through replacement or rebuilding of assets either through the financial assistance from CARE and through the income from their enterprise operations. Program Performance The following are the findings related to program performance The vulnerability of the beneficiaries were generally characterized by lack of disposable income, a limited asset base and livelihood opportunities. Efforts to address these issues mainly took the form of providing financial assistance, building human capacity through trainings , group formation, and linking to financial services. Providing both financial and capacity development assistance helped in increasing local capacity in managing enterprises. Some livelihood activities are more appropriate or are the better option for some local economic and environmental contexts at particular points in time. During the early recovery phase, the goal was to provide quick impact, low capital livelihood activities through household cash transfers. For medium term recovery, the goal was to promote market oriented livelihood, or micro or small business enterprise through the CEFs and WEFs. Cash transfer pooling was one of the more exceptional and fruitful ways of starting a group owned micro enterprise. The collaborative micro enterprises showed some scale up and sustainability potentials that eventually developed through the CEF. The use of the value chain approach supports the ongoing effort to increase revenue, to access a range of livelihood assets, and to reduce operating costs of micro enterprises. WEF and CEF projects have been increasingly directed towards enterprises that have strong market scale up potential through greater backward, forward and horizontal linkages. A more market oriented livelihood assistance provided to the households played an important means in recovery especially in places where farming and fishing could not be immediately resumed. Moreover, the Program has identified and engaged partners to complete a network that provides beneficiaries with access to a range of livelihood assets, e.g., marketing, technical and business development support services, financing, and risk protection services such as insurance and risk mapping. Partnership with competent facilitating partners has enhanced the importance of community facilitators who are experts in enterprise management, understand the local value chain and know key industry players. For example, CARE benefitted from BizFTC that is knowledgeable on enterprise risk management, or from Antique Development Foundation that has a wealth of experience in community enterprise development and local government networks. Fatima Cooperative has post harvest facilities and network system for savings build up. It facilitated the work of CARE and the Program beneficiaries making productive use of local resources like cassava in building capital from their own savings. Important partners from the government and private sector were identified for the beneficiaries with the adoption of the value chain approach. Contracting agreements for training and coaching activities, provision of farm machineries and equipment, and marketing partnerships were made to ensure more long term results. In partnership agreements with the government, the Program ensured that there is no duplication but instead complementation of programs. The gender strategy was very relevant and appropriate to the livelihood recovery as well as to the longer term challenges beneficiaries face in building competitive, growthoriented and sustainable livelihoods. The gender responsive value chain analysis facilitated the identification of gender issues and identified ways and means of integrating women’s and men’s needs and opportunities in the enterprises. The integration of gender in needs assessment, proposal development, activities and outcomes was done promptly. The disaster risk reduction – climate change adaptation DRR CCA practices adopted particularly in the value chain analysis and enterprise activities contributed to minimizing enterprise risks and maximizing results. Mainstreaming climate change and disaster risk reduction involved mobilizing beneficiaries and communities to increase their awareness of local DRR CCA issues and the importance of environmental sustainability, and develop a shared approach to addressing community enterprise priorities. CARE exercises ‘do no harm’ policy and communicate key accountability principles throughout the phases of the program cycle. CARE and local facilitating partners made a deliberate effort to identify and prioritize households that needed most help. They consulted these households about their needs for livelihoods recovery. Protocols for communicating beneficiaries’ complaints and grievances to CARE and the local facilitating partners provided particular assistance needed. The evaluation identified the following key challenges While the shifts from HHCT to WEF and CEF were noted and successes were reported, these were achieved not without overcoming challenges. Among the challenges encountered were a low production level due to lack of good equipment b inability to reach demand requirements of the market and c upgraded enterprise management skills of the CEF project management that meet the standards of the markets. Lessons Learned The following are the most meaningful lessons from the Program that can provide decision makers with relevant information for future programming 1. A sustainable livelihood program can improve the poor’s ability to protect and promote their economic conditions when this includes a comprehensive analysis of vulnerability context of their livelihood conditions. Based on HHCT experience, vulnerable households tend to allocate their scarce resources to maintain consumption levels and reduce risk rather than to maximize profit or income as in the case of WEF beneficiaries. 2. In designing inclusive and market oriented livelihood intervention, the use of value chain approach for priority sector could guide the beneficiaries in identifying opportunities in the market, and consider the constraints to exploiting these opportunities. To provide a foundation for analysis and technical guidance, the assistance from facilitating partners in undertaking a detailed value chain analysis is one good approach. 3. Providing business advisory support services, including access to market information, financing facilitation, technology transfer, business counselling, marketing and product development, rather than working with traditional business support systems, is important to the success of these enterprises. However, available resources and capacity should match the level of enterprise development of the beneficiaries. 4. Engaging with national and local government, non government organizations and the private sector facilitates the sustainability of these initiatives as these institutions can provide the necessary support services, particularly in the provision of technical and financial assistance for the scaling of production and business operations. 5. A holistic approach to gender mainstreaming is important for livelihood intervention of any kind to build deeper attitudinal and behavioural changes and greater levels of economic empowerment and participation in enterprise decision making. 6. Intensive monitoring and evaluation is important to track that beneficiaries and partners graduate to the next level of results. Monitoring will keep track of progress of the beneficiaries’ enterprises and provide much needed focused support. Recommendations The following recommendations will enhance the future programming 1. An integrated livelihood program employing market oriented approaches is an appropriate response to ensure resilience of the livelihood enterprises. To ensure its sustainability, a comprehensive support of value chain analysis and upgrading and technical expertise on entrepreneurship, and results based monitoring and evaluation approaches should be provided through competent facilitating partners or service facilitators or providers. 2. The existing collaboration of individual and community enterprises with government agencies and private sector players can still be strengthened for better impacts. These include coordination with local stakeholders to provide more efficient and effective delivery service and to link beneficiaries with business support systems such as markets, technology and finance. 3. Capacity building efforts must focus on the delivery of the business support services as well as in managing risks. Institutions that are not able to manage risks effectively can quickly become overwhelmed, seriously jeopardizing their ability to continue to provide services. 4. Improve program monitoring and evaluation systems and tools, and ensure their integration with facilitating partners’ tools and systems. Weaknesses in tracking results should be addressed through additional training and technical assistance for partners to adopt appropriate tools for monitoring and evaluation at the project level. Additional support is needed for program staff to improve analysis of monitoring and evaluation results.","['Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Storm Surge', 'Tropical Cyclone']"
" OVERVIEW Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean LAC experience a multitude of natural hazards, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tsunamis, landslides, volcanoes, forest fires, and drought. El Niño, a climate pattern that occurs on average once every three to seven years, periodically exacerbates the impacts of hydrometeorological events. Environmental degradation and poor land use management also increase populations’ vulnerability to natural hazards. USAID’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance USAID OFDA supports disaster risk reduction DRR programs aimed at saving lives, alleviating human suffering, and reducing the social and economic impact of disasters in LAC. These programs include risk identification, prioritization, and reduction, as well as post disaster recovery and short term rehabilitation projects. The focus of DRR funding in LAC is to enhance local and national self sufficiency in disaster preparedness and management throughout the region. To this end, USAID OFDA’s programs build upon and strengthen the capacity of established national and regional disaster management institutions, many of which are capable of meeting the majority of emergency needs after an event. Established in 1989, the Regional Disaster Assistance Program RDAP is the primary vehicle for USAID OFDA’s support of disaster risk management in LAC. USAID OFDA’s team of five regional advisors based in San José, Costa Rica, and a consultant network of 20 disaster risk management specialists dispersed throughout the region, oversee and monitor RDAP and other DRR programs. Since its inception, RDAP has contributed to the increased capacity of disaster management personnel and governments in LAC countries. As this capacity has improved, USAID OFDA support has shifted from a strictly instructional approach to providing more technical assistance for planning, strengthening, and centralizing the role of national organizations in disaster management. USAID OFDA’s technical assistance focuses on supporting local disaster management trainers to instruct local disaster responders in emergency response procedures. Through RDAP, USAID OFDA has helped expand local and regional capabilities, improve intra and inter governmental coordination, and strengthen disaster preparedness and mitigation activities, as well as risk management initiatives. USAID OFDA supports the development of risk management in LAC through a wide range of programs. During FY 2012, USAID OFDA provided nearly 16.9 million for DRR projects throughout LAC, including programs that integrate DRR with disaster response. The programs discussed herein include both FY 2012 funded programs as well as ongoing programs funded in previous fiscal years.","['Drought', 'Earthquake', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Tropical Cyclone', 'Tsunami', 'Volcano', 'Wild Fire']"
" Highlights With ten new cases of cholera reported in Dadaab camps, active cholera transmission in Tana River County, diarrheal outbreak in Lamu county and start of rains, cholera cases are likely to increase. During outreach activities conducted in first half of April in Turkana County and in North Horr Marsabit County 8,738 children were screened for acute malnutrition with over 40 per cent identified as acutely malnourished 35.6 moderately and 4.6 severely . All affected children were immediately admitted for treatment. With UNICEF support 37 of 48 planned water points in droughtaffected counties of Turkana, Garissa and Marsabit have been repaired benefitting 70,558 people including 4,789 school children During the reporting period, 2,413 cartons of RUTF were dispatched to Wajir, Garissa, Tana River and Turkana counties. From January to March 2017, UNICEF and partners reached over 14,500 severely malnourished children with lifesaving nutrition treatment. UNICEF received generous contributions from the UK Government, Dutch National Committee, ECHO and CERF in support of the humanitarian response in Kenya. UNICEF has only 35.8 per cent of the humanitarian funds available. Situation Overview Humanitarian Needs Despite delayed onset, the long rains started in various parts of Central, Eastern and North Eastern Kenya which temporarily eased dryness and water shortages. However, decreased rains are forecasted across most drought affected counties and outlook is not expected to improve seasonal dryness. In the drought affected counties of Garissa, Isiolo, Wajir and Tana River rains eased tension over resources, mainly water and pasture, and community members displaced from Garissa because of drought are slowly returning In Dukana Marsabit County . Heavy rains left over 13,000 goats dead as the animals were already weakened by ongoing drought and unable to withstand heavy rains. In Tana River County, flooding was reported with river water levels going up to 4.95 m above flood mark of 4m and community members living along the river were advised to move to higher grounds. This is likely to exacerbate risks of active cholera transmission in Tana River County. Drought induced displacements continue in northern parts of the country. In Garbatulla Isiolo County , over 13,400 people have been displaced due to drought and 8,650 due to conflict over scarce resources. In East Pokot approximately 1,806 households 10,597 people and 6,018 children are still displaced residing in 23 safe sites in Baringo North and Marigat sub counties. Through integrated outreach activities in the first half of April in Turkana County and in North Horr Marsabit County , a total of 8,738 children were screened for acute malnutrition with 40.2 per cent identified as acutely malnourished 35.6 per cent moderately malnourished, and 4.6 per cent severely malnourished and immediately admitted for treatment. The data highlights that ongoing treatment for moderate acute malnutrition is likely cushioning the incidence of severe acute malnutrition, although of concern are the increasing numbers of moderately acutely malnourished children, therefore, highlighting the urgent need for increased household food access. The planned start up of Blanket Supplementary Feeding Program BSFP by WFP in late April in most affected parts of Turkana and Marsabit will address this need. However, WFP is struggling to raise funds for full coverage and tens of thousands of vulnerable children are at risk of moderate malnutrition. Disease outbreaks continue to be reported in the country with ten 10 new cholera cases reported in Dadaab Refugee Complex between 2 and 17 April – two cases each in Dagahley and Hagadera and six in Ifo 2 camps. Cases were referred and treated managed at the Cholera Treatment Centers set up in the camp health facilities, and discharged. All the cases were from the recently arrived refugees from Somalia. In Lamu County, an upsurge of Acute Watery Diarrhea AWD cases was reported in Mpeketoni Division, with a total of 27 cases line listed, including one hospitalbased death and three community deaths. Laboratory specimens were shipped to National Public Health Laboratories NPHLs for testing and confirmation of causative organism. Cholera outbreak in Tana River County is still active. In the crop producing areas of Kenya, an outbreak of new devastating pest is threatening the yields and livelihoods of farmers. Due to infestation of army worms, there is uncertainty over yields among maize farmers in the North Rift region leading to increased cost of production and anticipated low harvest this season. The army worms have destroyed hundreds of acres of maize crops in the country’s food basket, with most farmers complaining of incurring huge costs to contain them and with likelihood of worsening food security situation in the country The National Drought Management Authority estimates that current milk availability is at an all time low of 3 8 per cent of normal in the arid lands. This highlights a major nutritional risk factor given that milk is the main source of nutrition for young children in pastoral arid areas. In Baringo, health service provision is negatively affected by insecurity and ongoing military interventions especially in Pokot East sub county. Health workers are staying away from work in most of the facilities in Pokot East, with Chemolingot Hospital not fully operational and only with skeletal staff. While military interventions in Baringo and Laikipa counties have reduced violent intercommunal conflicts, clashes over water resources were reported in Marsabit County. Between 10 – 13 April, in Qubi Kallo and Shurr areas about 30 kms from Marsabit town , three children one 10 year old and two 17 years old and 6 men were killed due to resourcebased conflict over access to a water point in Qubi Kallo Gabra Borana communities . Women and children in North Pokot Sub County are still traveling long distances to access water and thereby being at risk, as all the water pans had dried up and 90 per cent of boreholes are not working and require to be repaired. The County Water Department is trucking water using three water trucks for Pokot North, Central, part of the West and lower Pokot South. Kambioos camp, the smallest of five refugee camps in Dadaab, was closed with the 6,435 refugees in Kambioos moved to Hagadera camp. According to IOM’s DTM4 about 500 individuals from Bay and Middle Juba regions of Somalia have crossed the border and reached Dadaab Kenya . These are spontaneous returnees from drought affected areas in Somalia that reportedly returned to Kenya due to the severe conditions in Somalia because of the drought.","['Drought', 'Epidemic', 'Insect Infestation']"
" South Sudan’s hunger crisis is leaving girls at greater risk of early marriage. This publication seeks to understand the drivers of early marriage and highlight solutions to address it SOUTH SUDANESE GIRLS FORCED INTO EARLY MARRIAGES TO MEET THEIR FAMILY’S NEEDS By Jemima Tumalu, Communications Officer “I was in primary seven when my parents forced me to marry,” says 15 year old Adut, a mother of one. At the age of 13, Adut was forced to marry a 42 year old man and drop out of school. Conflict forced Adut and her family to flee their village and seek shelter at an Internally Displaced Persons camp in Tonj South where she lives now. “We fled and sought refuge here since what we called home was destroyed and in ruins,” she says. She says that before conflict interrupted her family’s life they were not very poor and could afford two meals a day. Once they were displaced and their means of earning an income was destroyed, life became too hard. Adut’s parents saw their daughter as their only opportunity to survive. ”My family was given 15 cows as my bride price,” she sadly reports. “I had to drop out of school, manage a family and separate from my parents.” Sadly, Adut’s situation is not unique. Nearly half of all girls in South Sudan marry before the age of 18. A 2013 report from Human Rights Watch1 highlights that dowry often leads families to force their girls to marry as early as possible, often after first menstruation. In South Sudan, dowry is paid by the groom and his family and can include cattle, money and other gifts. After marriage, Adut’s life revolved around assisting her husband sell charcoal, which is his only source of income. “Sometimes we sleep hungry due to a lack of food if no one bought charcoal from us. I also sell charcoal at home or collect firewood from the forest to supplement my husband’s earning.” They do not have a support system and Adut says she did not benefit from the bride price. “My mother feels embarrassed because of the situation I am in right now and has never visited me. I did not benefit from the cows given to my family and do not have anything to feed on.” According to 2020 research published in the Journal of Black Studies2 about early marriage in South Sudan, traditional gender norms in South Sudan mean that girls have little decision making power, with parents and male siblings instead responsible for making decisions on their behalf, “including getting them married without their consent” writes the research study’s author Kon M. Madut. “I regret this marriage but had no option,” Adut says. “If I get money, I want to go back to school and fulfil my dream of becoming a doctor.” She says that before her husband started the charcoal business, he was working as a shop attendant but when a few things went missing, he was imprisoned for a week before he was released. “We would cry with my daughter Ajak Manut and sleep uneasily. I was always scared at night because I had not slept alone,” she says. World Vision, with support from United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, funds the South Sudan Humanitarian Project in Tonj South. The goal of this humanitarian project is to respond through multi sectoral interventions to crisisaffected population in greater Tonj. Affected sectors include health, nutrition, food security and livelihood as well as protection addressing issues such as child marriage forced marriage. Joseph Deng, a World Vision project manager says, “The project has a component of community awareness on early child marriage, child rights abuse, Gender Based Violence and peace building. These activities will have positive impacts in terms of changing the mindset of the community on the issues mentioned. This is the only way we can change and educate our community about negative and unproductive behaviors.” Adut is not her real name .","['Drought', 'Other']"
" Appeal highlights As of September 2020, there have been over 4.3 million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 COVID 19 and nearly 132,000 deaths in Brazil. This is the second highest number of cases globally and the highest number of COVID 19 deaths in the region. The pandemic has exacerbated pre existing disparities and vulnerabilities in Brazil. While the country's richest and most populous Southeastern region has the highest number of cases, COVID 19 has quickly spread into vulnerable territories, with 1.8 million cases and 51,000 deaths in the North and Northeast regions. Working with State and municipal authorities, UNICEF will respond to the COVID 19 crisis in 150 municipalities and 55 urban neighborhoods that are already covered by UNICEF programmes.

" Highlights The Israeli government’s withholding of an estimated USD 375 million in Palestinian tax revenues it collects on behalf of the Palestinian Government, has led to increased tensions in the State of Palestine. This is jeopardizing the regular provision of public services and exacerbating the tense relations between the Palestinian Government and Hamas over the provision of services in the Gaza Strip. Three children aged 2, 3 and 13, were wounded by the explosion of an UXO on 17 February, which they found outside their home in the north of the Gaza Strip. UNICEF responded to the flooding of the Wadi Gaza, on 22 February, by providing children’s clothing, blankets, and adult and baby hygiene kits to 99 affected families through the Palestinian Red Crescent Society PRCS , in coordination with the Shelter Cluster and the Ministry of Social Affairs MoSA . The number of IDPs in UNRWA Collective Centers stands at 9,490. Six months after the fragile ceasefire that ended the tragic summer hostilities in Gaza, the situation in the Strip is far worse than before the conflict. Limited access to essential and public services and slow reconstruction have increased the population’s vulnerability and hampered their copying skills. Nearly 300,000 children in the Gaza Strip are still in need of psychosocial support , six months after the ceasefire. UNICEF, through the Palestinian Centre for Democracy and Conflict Resolution PCDCR , has provided psychosocial support to 40,817 children 19,871 girls and 20,946 boys since 15 September 2014.

" Country Overview The Government of Bangladesh GoB will allow all public transport, except goods transporters, to run during the upcoming Muslim Eid ul Azha festival 31 July 2 August . Cattle markets will be allowed to operate in specifically designated areas. The demand for animals to sacrifice is predicted to be low as the COVID 19 pandemic has hit the economy hard. Farmers have already started selling their cattle at low prices to meat traders out of fear of incurring losses. As of 23 July, COVID 19 negative certificates from government authorized testing centres will be required by airline passengers leaving Bangladesh. Since the GoB introduced a COVID 19 testing fee minimum USD2.36 , the rate of testing has decreased significantly. The GoB approved the final or phase 3 human trial of a COVID 19 vaccine by a Chinese firm.

"On 9 April 2021, the La Soufrière volcano in St. Vincent and the Grenadines erupted, causing a crisis on top of the COVID crisis for the people of the island nation. Didier Trebucq, UN Resident Coordinator for Barbados and the Eastern Caribbean, visited affected areas of the country shortly after the eruption, and again six months after. Here are his reflections. “Apocalyptic” is the word that sprang to mind when I visited communities in the orange and red zones just nine days after the devastating eruption of La Soufrière. A thick sulfur odor permeated the air. Desolate villages, once alive with community spirit, were blanketed in grey ash. Homes were damaged, roofs bowed, crops decimated, and paved roads reduced to tracks. Some residents took on the arduous task of shoveling stubborn debris from roofs and roadways, as stray animals roamed on what looked like a lunar landscape. The social, productive and infrastructure sectors had been hit with damages and losses of about US 275 million, affecting livelihoods and displacing 20,000 people and putting them at risk of food insecurity. It was difficult to reconcile the sight of this wasteland with the lush landscapes, bountiful banana crops, and lively island vibe I’d experienced on previous visits. The dystopian sight will forever remain etched in my memory. The aftermath and 6 months later From the onset of this “crisis within a crisis,” the UN Team for Barbados and Eastern Caribbean has partnered with the Government, civil society, regional and development partners, to ensure a sustainable recovery of the people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and leave no one behind. Together, we supported the immediate response and are now supporting long term recovery and reconstruction. In the immediate aftermath, the UN helped procure relief supplies, and specialists from WFP, UNICEF, and PAHO WHO were deployed to provide support. Six months later, on my return to Saint Vincent and the Grenadines on 28 October to observe United Nations Day, a sense of rebirth was palpable. The skies were now sunny, the ocean was clear, and the land was green with trees and shrubs. There was hope. I was encouraged to hear from residents and Government partners how the UN’s timely support helped to make a tangible difference in people’s lives. Our efforts have not abated, and the UN team continues to support national authorities on the path to recovery in the areas of ash clean up, cash support, relocation and temporary housing, livelihoods, WASH water, sanitation, and hygiene , and health systems to prevent the spread of COVID 19. Continued COVID 19 prevention and support for increased vaccine uptake remains a priority. Most importantly, the recovery is an opportunity to rebuild better and increase the resilience of both people and housing stock to external shocks. Where are we now? Since our launch of a funding appeal which was generously supported by many international donors, including USAID, Japan, UK, EU, Spain, Germany, and Canada, amongst others, we had the privilege to work in myriad areas to help the people of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, who have demonstrated an extraordinary resilience and sense of solidarity. Some notable achievements include Multiple rounds of cash transfers to over 3,500 evacuated households, with WFP support. Academic and psychosocial support for 2,000 students across 45 schools, with UNICEF assisting the Ministry of Education. Sufficient access to potable water made available to most households in affected areas, thanks in part to UN support. Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries supported in the development of anticipatory action, emergency preparedness and rapid response protocols for livestock, crops and fisheries by FAO, that helped to reduce mortalities and support smoother transition to recovery. Over 15,000 cubic yards of ash was removed from schools and recreational areas through an ash and debris clean up initiative, with the support of UNEP and UNDP. Over 1,500 students were able to return to school and 185 persons, 40 women, were provided with short term employment through this initiative. Improved hygiene practices in over 1,000 households, with UNICEF support. Mental health services, purchase of medical and health supplies, and WASH interventions in 20 health care facilities, supported by PAHO. Over 1,200 metric tonnes of humanitarian relief cargo, and 730 metric tonnes of food assistance and other supplies, with WFP support. A critical Post Disaster Needs Assessment, was performed by UNDP, the World Bank and the EU and other UN agencies and will support strategic reconstruction and recovery. The International Organization of Migration IOM is also providing support for transition to permanent housing and building back more resilient. My colleagues and I are inspired by the neighbourliness and optimism of the people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, under even the most harrowing circumstances. I want them all to know that the UN will continue to work together as one team to support them on path to recovery. There’s still a lot of work ahead. But hope is on the horizon.

Heavy rains in eastern Uganda saturated the densely populated slopes of the Mount Elgon region, resulting in massive landslides that submerged entire villages under sludge and debris. According to Uganda's Red Cross, the mudslides wreaked havoc upon more than 120,000 residents, killing more than 50 people. The Adventist Development and Relief Agency ADRA is responding to the immediate needs of those affected through the distribution food and emergency relief supplies. When I woke up and realized what was happening, my house was already broken in half and the neighbor's houses were already in the mud, shared a victim of the mudslides. I lost my father and the eldest son. He was 19 years old. We lost everything we had. My neighbor lost everything. They were buried all of them, with all their possessions. ADRA's intervention is being carried out in the sub county of Sisiyi, distributing two week rations of food consisting of maize meal, beans, and salt. In addition, ADRA is distributing NFI's including waterproof tarps as an additional form of shelter, cookware, blankets, and mosquito nets a preventative measure from contracting malaria. ADRA is targeting their response to households with pregnant and lactating mothers, infants, elderly, and those suffering from HIV AIDS. Lingering since August, the torrential rains overwhelmed the over settled region by Mount Elgon, leaving more than 1500 homes demolished by the heavy mud. Adding to the troubling situation, the landslides submerged pit latrines, which has caused sanitation related challenges to arise. Reuters has reported that residential settling has razed much of the mountainsides in eastern Uganda, leaving the region vulnerable to deadly landslides. Reports from the ADRA Uganda office stated that schools and roads are completely inaccessible. In addition, scores of homes, crops, and animals are buried under the landslides' debris.

" Media statement Members of the media Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you for your presence. The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries DAFF recently 03 February 2017 received a diagnostic report from the Agricultural Research Council, Plant Protection Research Institute ARC PPRI which confirms that the Fall Army Worm was positively identified from samples collected in the Limpopo Province. The samples were jointly collected by scientists from the ARC Grain Institute and the North West University. These were caterpillars that had to pupate and emerge as moths before a positive identification could be done. In addition moths were collected on Friday 3 February from the northern parts of Gauteng and positively identified as Fall Army Worm. Fall Army Worm is native to South and Central America and also occurs in the southern states of the USA. The first detection of Fall Army Worm in Africa was notified in January 2016 when it was reported from Nigeria. From there it spread to several other West African countries and to Central Africa by April 2016. Media reports from Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi indicated an outbreak of this pest during December 2016. DAFF informed commodity and research organisations of a possible threat and encouraged producers to report suspicious pest damage. This initiated possible pest reports which led to sample collection and positive identifications. The Fall Army Worm is a strong flyer and could be distributed by prevailing winds over large distances. The department realises that transboundary pests and diseases, especially migratory pests threaten food security and that coordinated regional efforts are important to address these risks. The department will therefore participate at the upcoming engagement hosted by the Food and Agricultural Organization, which claims to strengthen and align efforts strengthen controls of plant and animal pests and diseases. We will equally continue to our engagement with SADC to ensure early warnings of these biological threats are in place. The South African Emergency Plant Pest Response Plan is already in motion which deals with new pest detections in South Africa. The actions implemented depend on the pest, the extent of the spread and extent of the damage. Now that there is a positive identification, DAFF will continue with assessment of spread and damage, awareness actions to provide farmers with accurate technical information and control options. Pheromone traps will be imported into South Africa to determine the exact extent of the spread and the specific strain of FAW present in South Africa. Diagnostic support has been increased to deal the bulk of sample identification. As the Fall Army Worm is a new pest to South Africa, no pesticide was previously registered to be used against it. A process of emergency registration of agricultural chemicals is ongoing with two active ingredients are already registered to be applied against this pest. As with all agricultural remedy applications the label instructions must be followed in accordance to the supplier’s recommendations. Having received various reports of the incidence of the pest, and having undertaken sample collection in Limpopo and Gauteng, the department will now undertake a more comprehensive survey to determine the spread of the pest. In parallel to this, damage assessment will be done and, as appropriate, the necessary actions undertaken to manage the pest. An awareness campaign has been rolled out to all provinces to provide technically correct information regarding the management of the pest. Extensive information on this pest is available from other parts of the world. We have identified specific research focus areas in South Africa that will allow for a deeper understanding of the behaviour and biology of the pest. This will enable the improvement of relevant management and control strategies. DAFF has also initiated a plant pest action group which consists of members from provincial Departments of Agriculture, researchers, several producers associations and industries which may be affected by this pest. The group will meet regularly to evaluate progress and results. The presence of the pest will be notified on the International Plant Protection Convention’s portal in terms of South Africa’s international pest reporting obligations. SADC member countries will also be notified and regional control measures will be discussed. I appreciate the support already expressed from Grain SA and the South African National Seed Organizations, the ARC and North West University to assist with the pest surveillance. I will be visiting some of the affected areas this coming Friday. Crop producers are encouraged to report suspected presence of this pest to the Department.

" Executive summary AVSI Foundation in collaboration with the South Sudan Nutrition Cluster conducted a SMART nutrition and mortality survey covering all the eight Payams of the former Ikwoto County in the former Eastern Equatoria State. The main objective of the survey was to assess the current prevalence of acute malnutrition and retrospective mortality rates in the County. The Standardized Methodology for Assessment in Relief and Transitions SMART which applies a two stage cluster sampling was used. A total of 623 children aged 6 59 months from 532 households in 36 clusters were sampled for anthropometric measurements. The mortality assessment was conducted concurrently in all 532 households. Additional information on Infant and Young Child Feeding practices IYCF was collected in the 532 households visited to provide more insight into possible risk factors associated with the high acute malnutrition prevalence. The survey was conducted in the last days of November, at the peak of the harvest season, after a cultivation season characterized by relatively low level of insecurity and abundant rains. The prevalence of Global Acute Malnutrition GAM defined as Weight for Height 2 Z scores and or oedema for the County was 10.3 7.9 13.3 95 C.I. and the severe acute malnutrition SAM prevalence defined as Weight for Height 3 Z scores and or oedema was 1.6 0.9 3.1 95 C.I. The GAM and SAM prevalence indicated a serious nutrition situation according to WHO classification. Two edema cases were identified during the assessment. The crude mortality rate CMR and under five mortality rate U5MR were 1.79 1.32 – 2.42 95 C.I . and 1.24 0.47 3.21 95 C.I. respectively. The CMR rate was above the WHO emergency thresholds of 1 10,000 day. The U5MR was below the WHO emergency threshold of 2 10,000 day and was therefore classified as ‘Alert’. Most deaths were due to illness 73.8 . Information on infant and young child feeding IYCF practices was collected. The proportion of children exclusively breastfeeding to the age of 6 months was 78 , lower than the WHO recommended standard of 80 . Another 76.2 of children 0 23.9 months were initiated to breastfeeding within one hour after delivery. Introduction of solid, semi solid or soft foods among children aged 6 to 8.9 months was low 51.5 . Findings indicated poor IYCF practices.

The entire political system from the central to the local level has promptly entered the task of directing natural disaster response, trying to minimize the damage caused by natural disasters to the lowest level, but the consequences of natural disasters are still very heavy. Quang Tri is one of the provinces most severely damaged by natural disasters. In addition to the efforts of the Government and people of Vietnam in disaster response and recovery, there is also the help of international partners to help people overcome difficulties and stabilize their lives. In order to get this timely support, the Central Steering Committee on natural disaster prevention and control, as the national disaster management agency through the Disaster Risk Mitigation Partnership, actively shared information about the disaster situation to call for and coordinate with international partners, the United Nations agencies and non governmental organizations in Vietnam to contribute to timely mobilization of support to help the Government and people of Vietnam overcome the consequences of natural disaster. More than 14 billion VND from the ADB grant will help 106 households affected by floods and storms in Huong Hoa, Dakrong, Cam Lo, Gio Linh and Vinh Linh districts rebuild their houses, stabilize their daily life, at the same time improve resilience to future natural disasters. With a total of 106 households supported in housing construction, spread across 64 villages and hamlets mainly remote areas, areas with difficult travel terrain in which many houses are located in difficult terrain, construction conditions, materials transportation in 22 communes, the town in the area of ​​05 districts Huong Hoa, Dakrong, Cam Lo, Gio Linh, Vinh Linh. The beneficiaries of construction support are poor, near poor and disadvantaged households affected by natural disasters of which over 95 are of ethnic minorities. During the implementation process, the localities Hamlet, Commune, District organized the assessment and selection of beneficiaries of housing construction objectively, democratically, openly and transparently The subjects are supported in accordance with the criteria of the aid agreement. The design and cost estimate for each house is made according to the norms and unit price and has been appraised by the Department of Construction according to the current regulations The houses built in this phase are equivalent to those of similar households being built currently in the area. Each house, depending on geographical location, the number of people in each family has the highest building value of 140 million, the lowest nearly 92 million for a house with 1 to 2 people This is a direct aid to build basic housing completed in terms of use and has the greatest value ever for households. The selected construction units are those experienced in implementing construction in mountainous, remote, and disadvantaged areas. The commencement work to implement the construction is very urgent, effective and receives the attention, support and coordination of all concerned agencies, units and localities. The success after implementing this aid not only helps people to soon stabilize their lives, feel secure in production and recovery after natural disasters, but also ensures the reputation of local authorities for their commitment to implement according to international requirements. After natural disasters in 2020, especially historic floods that took place in October and November, together with the proactiveness, determination and efforts to overcome and reconstruct after disaster of sectors and localities. Quang Tri province has received a lot of encouragement, sharing and timely support in spirit and material from the Central Government, organizations and individuals in Vietnam and overseas to support the province to overcome the difficulties after natural disasters. In particular, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, whose standing is the Vietnam Disaster Management Agency has mobilized and directly supported Quang Tri in many ways, such as donated 1,000 kitchen sets for households that were flooded supplied plant seeds, animals, materials, equipment to restore production with a value of nearly 17 billion VND, ..... Called the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office to support the construction of 02 community houses for disaster prevention with the value of 3.7 billion VND. Specially the agency organized survey teams and called on international organizations to support emergency aid programs to overcome the consequences of natural disasters, including an emergency aid of 14.4 billion VND from Asian Development Bank ADB to support the construction of housing for families affected by natural disasters. This is meaningful and timely for the people of Quang Tri province.","['Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Tropical Cyclone']"
"Ibrahim Ahmaid After the devastating Beirut explosion last year, the population continues to face a number of crises. Since the blast, NORCAP experts have been working to coordinate humanitarian efforts and securing housing land and property rights during a tumultuous time. Six months have passed since an explosion of 2750 tons of badly stored ammonium nitrate took Beirut by surprise. The explosion that shook the centrally located port of the city was unprecedented, causing the death of at least 204 people, 7500 injuries, USD 15 billion in property damage, and leaving an estimated 300 000 people homeless. An influx of assistance The ongoing political and economic crisis in Lebanon had already been exacerbated by the pandemic. Repercussions from the explosion amplified the dire situation, putting pressure on the international community to act fast to help those in need. The initial response saw the influx of several actors from civil society who did not necessarily understand humanitarian principles and instruments. Additionally, several actors already working for the Lebanon Crisis Response Plan had shifted efforts to respond to the needs of the port explosion victims, but were lacking humanitarian and emergency expertise. Together, these factors affected the speed and efficiency of the response, making coordination of the help efforts pouring into the country more important than ever. An area based approach NORCAP has deployed several experts to help reduce the gaps and overlaps in the assistance delivered by humanitarian organizations. Carolina Mansur was one of those working to coordinate the international response. In the early recovery efforts in Beirut, the NORCAP expert has been deployed to UN Habitat. Here, she has been working to make use of the organisation’s expertise on urban contexts, while also contributing to underpin the agency's support to the Government of Lebanon in developing a national urban policy. In Carolina’s work, it has been central to promote the implementation of projects using an area based approach. This implies looking at multiple needs within one area, rather than a sector or target group. “Communities affected by crisis have a holistic view of their recovery, which means it is important to have an understanding of the overall needs. In order to achieve this, it is vital to improve collaboration between the different sectors and stakeholders,” says Carolina. An area based approach is especially applicable in urban contexts, she explains. It is often associated with places similar to Lebanon, where there is a strong presence of local authorities and the existence of complex relationships. In these contexts, narrow external interventions can have strong, unintended impacts on other sectors. “International response and interventions should to a much greater extent be developed through applying an integrated lens. The return home Despite international and local efforts to help rehouse the victims of the explosion, many are still unable to go back to their homes. Lebanon was grappling with issues related to housing, land and property rights already before the blast. “Six months after the explosion, we are still experiencing additional housing, land and property issues. Many tenants have become indebted, as they have themselves paid for repairs and restructure. In some cases, repairs that were made increased the standard of the building, which led to landlords wanting to increase rent”, says Jenny Bjerlestam. Many of the neighbourhoods heavily damaged by the Beirut Port explosions are located in the old districts of Beirut, which are also high in land value. Thanks to pre existing rental conditions, these neighbourhoods accommodated residents of all income levels and demographic backgrounds. Many of these residents are unable to afford moving out or signing new rental contracts with updated rental rates. Jenny’s expertise has been particularly important in the protection of marginalized and disadvantaged groups. “After the blast, people living in the affected areas reported being approached by brokers wanting to procure property for large amounts of cash”, she says.",['Technological Disaster']
"Prepositioning relief supplies, increasing health system resilience and using data to inform action By Paul M. Sherer With the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season officially starting on June 1, Direct Relief is staging caches of emergency medical supplies along the U.S. Gulf and Atlantic Coasts and throughout the Caribbean and Central America. The humanitarian effort comes as global temperatures keep rising and the frequency and intensity of hurricanes and other disasters increase. The 2020 hurricane season was the most active on record, producing 30 named storms, 14 of them hurricanes. Two were Category 4 storms, Eta and Iota, that crashed into Nicaragua two weeks apart, causing catastrophic damage and triggering a massive wave of displacement. Direct Relief’s prepositioned modules contain the medical items most needed in the wake of a disaster, including trauma supplies, antibiotics, and medications for diabetes, hypertension and other chronic conditions. The supplies are made available through local health organizations serving communities most vulnerable to natural disasters. The modules vary in size from 112 pounds for individual clinics to larger 1,680 pound modules for international destinations. Direct Relief this year is staging the emergency modules at health facilities in every Southeastern and Gulf Coast state from Virginia to Texas, as well as in Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Saipan. Internationally, Direct Relief is prepositioning the modules throughout Central America and the Caribbean, including in Anguilla, the Bahamas, Barbados, British Virgin Islands, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Panama, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, as well as in Bangladesh, Fiji, and India. Increasing Health Infrastructure Resilience Where hurricanes go, power outages follow. Most notably, in 2017’s Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico went dark for months. Much of the island’s temperature sensitive medication spoiled, electronic health records were inaccessible, essential medical equipment was inoperable, and vital health services ceased. Hurricane Maria proved that power is a prerequisite for health. With the increase of climate change driven disasters, building resilient health infrastructure has become a core element of Direct Relief’s response activities. The organization has installed solar power arrays and battery backup systems at community health centers across the U.S. In Puerto Rico, Direct Relief, with support from AbbVie https www.directrelief.org 2018 05 with 100 million from abbvie direct relief and habitat for humanity to strengthen access to healthcare housing for puerto rico and others, is equipping health facilities with 1.2 megawatts of solar production capacity https www.directrelief.org 2019 02 transitioning puerto rico health centers to a solar powered smart grid and 2.6 megawatts of battery storage. Projects include outfitting 89 health centers across the island with 164 FDA compliant pharmaceutical and laboratory refrigerators and freezers capable of storing roughly 6 million vials of vaccines furnishing 22 community water pumps https www.directrelief.org 2018 04 a puerto rico community powers its future with backup solar and battery storage installing full backup solar power and battery storage on a fire station that lost grid power for months and providing home based generators to 32 children who depend on powered equipment to breathe https www.directrelief.org 2020 08 families in puerto rico find a new source of power and for other medical needs. Data Driven Disaster Preparation Whether responding to storms, fires, or disease outbreaks, data increasingly guides Direct Relief’s work. Using various data sources, including the CDC ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index https www.atsdr.cdc.gov placeandhealth svi index.html and Facebook Disaster Maps https dataforgood.fb.com tools disaster maps , Direct Relief can identify areas at greatest risk from hurricanes, predict whether people will evacuate, and gauge the impact on local healthcare providers. “We’re increasingly able to get a real time, high resolution view of evacuation dynamics, medical needs, and the pressure placed on healthcare infrastructure,” said Andrew Schroeder, Direct Relief’s VP of Research and Analysis. Direct Relief is also looking at long term displacement of people whose livelihoods have been destroyed by hurricanes, such as those in parts of Central America hit sequentially last year by Hurricanes Eta and Iota. “There’s a geography to poverty that corresponds with physical risk,” Schroeder said. Covid 19 Summertime Disasters Why This Year May Be Different This hurricane and wildfire season is the second to overlap with the Covid 19 pandemic. While disease prevalence in the U.S. is down sharply from its 2020 peak, the summer of 2021 presents an additional challenge. Last year, emergency management agencies and aid groups could maintain social distancing by relocating disaster evacuees into hotels and motels, largely empty due to the steep drop in domestic travel. This summer, with travel rebounding sharply, those rooms will no longer be available, making it more challenging to safely shelter evacuees.","['Epidemic', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Tropical Cyclone']"
"By Gordon Willcock A deadly tsunami struck in the vicinity of the Sunda Straight on Saturday, impacting the islands of Sumatra and Java, Indonesia. Indonesia’s disaster management agency, the BNPB, is reporting that at least 222 people have been killed and hundreds more have been injured. Preliminary assessments are still being completed and some areas are yet to be reached, so it is likely that the death and injury toll will rise. Unlike most earthquake triggered tsunamis, this disaster is thought to have been caused by an undersea landslide as a result of ongoing volcanic activity at Anak Krakatoa. Indonesia has already been struck by multiple major earthquakes this year and recovery efforts are ongoing in those areas. The Lombok earthquake killed more than 600 and the Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami left more than 2100 dead and many more injured. The Muhammadiyah Disaster Management Centre MDMC , Direct Relief’s long time local partner, already has teams working on the ground in Banten and Lampung. In addition to coordinating with MDMC, Direct Relief emergency response staff are in contact with the ASEAN Coordination Center for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management AHA Centre and Bumi Sehat, and will continue to monitor the situation as it develops in the next 48 hours.",['Tsunami']
" AMMAN, 7 April 2022 Six weeks into the war in Ukraine, the fragile nutritional status of children in the Middle East and North Africa is expected to worsen. While Muslims in the region observe the holy month of Ramadan, disruption in imports caused by the conflict is creating food shortages amid high prices of essential commodities, including wheat, edible oils, and fuel. If this continues, it will severely impact children, especially in Egypt, Lebanon, Libya, Sudan, Syria and Yemen some are hunger hotspots according to recent assessments 1 https www.unicef.org mena press releases war ukraine continues millions children middle east and north africa increased risk ftn1 undertaken prior to the Ukraine crisis, as those countries were already struggling with conflicts, economic crises, or a sharp increase in global food prices in 2021. With ongoing conflicts, political instability, the COVID 19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, the region is witnessing unprecedented hikes in food prices coupled with low purchasing power. The number of malnourished children is likely to drastically increase, said Adele Khodr, UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa. The ripple effect of the continuing war in Ukraine is compounding the impacts of two long years of the COVID 19 pandemic on economies, employment and poverty in the MENA region, where more than 90 per cent of food is imported. Many countries have already been struggling with child malnutrition, especially due to ongoing armed conflicts and humanitarian crises. Only 36 per cent of young children 2 https www.unicef.org mena press releases war ukraine continues millions children middle east and north africa increased risk ftn2 in the region are receiving the diets they need to grow and develop in a healthy way The region is home to high rates of undernutrition and micronutrient deficiencies. On an average, nearly one in five children is stunted while the average wasting rate is 7 per cent . In the MENA countries most impacted by the war in Ukraine, undernutrition rates are higher. In Yemen , 45 per cent of children are stunted and over 86 per cent have anaemia In Sudan , 13.6 per cent of children suffer from wasting, 36.4 per cent are stunted and nearly half have anaemia In Lebanon , 94 per cent of young children are not receiving the diets they need, while over 40 per cent of women and children under the age of five have anaemia In Syria , only one in four young children get the diets they need to grow healthy. The price of the average food basket has nearly doubled in 2021 alone. UNICEF continues to coordinate the nutrition response in the region. We call to consolidate efforts to urgently deliver and scale up prevention, early detection and treatment of malnutrition to address the needs of millions of children and women, especially in countries most impacted by crises. This is critical to prevent a massive malnutrition crisis for children in the region added Khodr. UNICEF works with partners to deliver and scale up lifesaving treatment services for children with severe wasting in conjunction with its early detection in children under five years old. Simultaneously, with partners, UNICEF delivers preventive nutrition services including micronutrient supplements, growth monitoring and counselling and support on breastfeeding and age appropriate complementary feeding. We stand ready to facilitate the revamping of the nutrition response in the region to further strengthen links with agriculture, social protection, education and water and sanitation sectors to reach more children in need, concluded Khodr. Notes to Editors In Syria, Lebanon, Sudan and Yemen, over 9.1 million children under the age of five, and a total of almost 13.8 million children and women are in need for nutrition assistance. Last year alone, UNICEF has been able to Provide nearly 3.5 million children under the age of five with micronutrient supplements Screen over 11 million children for wasting UNICEF MENA Regional Office redesigned an essential tool for malnutrition screening the Mid Upper Arm Circumference MUAC tape. To improve hygiene, the tapes are disposable and made entirely from eco friendly, biodegradable paper, with easy to follow instructions in Arabic and English printed on the back of the tapes using non toxic ink Provide treatment services for nearly 650,000 children with severe wasting Severe Acute Malnutrition Provide counselling to over 6 million women and caretakers of children on infant and young child feeding. According to WFP, the prices of cooking oil have hiked up by 36 per cent in Yemen and 39 per cent in Syria. Wheat flour prices have increased by 47 per cent in Lebanon, 15 per cent in Libya and 14 per cent in The State of Palestine. Stunting refers to a child who is too short for his or her age. Stunted children can suffer severe irreversible physical and cognitive damage that accompanies stunted growth. The devastating effects of stunting can last a lifetime and even affect the next generation. Wasting refers to a child who is too thin for his or her height. Wasting is the result of recent rapid weight loss or the failure to gain weight. A child who suffers from moderate or severe wasting has an increased risk of death, but treatment is possible. Undernutrition refers to both stunting and wasting. Dietary diversity refers to the consumption of diverse food groups during the day. A minimum dietary diversity requires young children to be fed at least five of these eight food groups. The eight food groups are 1 breastmilk 2 grains, roots and tubers 3 legumes, nuts and seeds 4 dairy milk, yoghurt, cheese 5 flesh foods meat, fish, poultry, and liver or organ meats 6 eggs 7 vitamin A rich fruits and vegetables carrots, mangoes, dark green leafy vegetables, pumpkins, orange sweet potato and 8 other fruits and vegetables UNICEF's response includes Children's nutrition packages, include Adequate breastfeeding early initiation within one hour of birth exclusive breastfeeding in the first five months and continued breastfeeding from 6 to 23 months.

"Robin Lim is an internationally recognized midwife known for the life saving work of her Indonesian based nonprofit, Yayasan Bumi Sehat Healthy Mother Earth Foundation . Also known as Ibu Mother Robin because of her role as a mother figure in Indonesia, her organization’s provision of free prenatal care, birthing services, and emergency medical aid became front page news when she won the CNN “Hero of the Year” award in 2011. Direct Relief’s partnership with Bumi Sehat began after the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami and has developed over the years into a longstanding commitment to support Bumi Sehat’s relentless efforts to improve the health of mothers and children in Indonesia and now the Philippines. When Typhoon Haiyan hit the island nation in November, the need for prenatal, birthing, and specifically midwife services increased exponentially. Recognizing the dire need for essential maternal and child health services in the wake the devastation, Robin – with the support of Direct Relief – brought a team of skilled and equipped healthcare professionals to the heart of the Typhoon Haiyan disaster zone to provide emergency medical relief and birthing services. For many people in this area who are earning roughly 2.00 a day, the 1,000 pesos 22.00 needed to pay for a delivery in a medical facility is unthinkable. For some pregnant women in this region, the decision comes down to food for their families or a safe birth in a medical facility, with many choosing to give birth at home without a skilled and equipped provider present. Mirasol Belleza is one of those women who would have been unable to access prenatal and delivery services had it not been for the free care provided at Bumi Sehat and sponsored by Direct Relief. She was six months pregnant when the typhoon hit, destroying her home and leaving her without the ability to pay for skilled medical care. Over the past six months, Robin has built out a comprehensive medical relief camp that provides prenatal, delivery, postpartum, and primary health care for mothers and their children. Nearly 400 babies have been delivered safely at the camp, all of whom were born to mothers who experienced the devastation of the typhoon in their communities. When Direct Relief’s Emergency Response Team visited the camp in April, it was buzzing with activity—from moms getting prenatal checkups, to getting vaccinations for their babies, to one who was in active labor. Everyone the team spoke to said it was a blessing to have this service in an area so devastated by the typhoon. Direct Relief continues to support the camp with thousands of nutritional supplements, antibiotics, exam gloves, pain relievers, and I.V. solutions. Additionally, two Direct Relief Midwife Kits were provided to Robin and her team of midwives, to ensure these providers have the right medicines, supplies, and equipment to continue the life saving work. Direct Relief is honored to partner with Ibu Mother Robin and her dedicated team as they work tirelessly to provide care for mothers who need it most. You can help midwives around the world, like Mother Robin and her team, prevent maternal and infant deaths.

" IOM Vision IOM Afghanistan assists people in need across the country with timely and effective life saving humanitarian support, transition and recovery, including vulnerable returnees, people affected by natural disaster and conflict, and impacted host communities. IOM builds the capacity of the government and civil society on migration management, and builds the resilience of people and communities to mitigate risks, to recover from crises, and to reintegrate people returning home in a sustainable and holistic manner. IOM works with Government and partners across the humanitarian development peace nexus and will seek to adjust programming to support the ongoing peace process as appropriate. Context analysis Forty years of conflict have shaped Afghanistan as a country of displacement, migration, and return. The intensifying armed conflict in 2020 and the continuing deterioration of the protection environment for civilians, exacerbated by the COVID 19 pandemic and subsequent economic downturn, is driving a large volume of displacement and cross border out flows into Iran, Pakistan, and beyond. Significant annual returns of undocumented Afghans also continue, with over 838,000 undocumented returnees as of 19 December 2020 Source IOM Afghanistan Weekly Situation Report Return of Undocumented Afghans 13 19 December 2020 . 2021 is shaping up to be one of the highest cross border return years on record.

" Highlights UNICEF works in 22 countries and territories in Europe and Central Asia Region ECAR and is present in Italy, targeting refugee and migrant populations. In 2020 • The first case of COVID 19 was detected in February and quickly spread across ECAR. 7.7 million people were infected, and 174,574 COVID 19 deaths were recorded by the end of the year. The highest peaks occurred in March April and then October November. Officially, Turkmenistan maintained it had no confirmed cases. • UNICEF procured over 39.7 million in COVID 19 supplies, 20 of which for WASH. Over 4.6 million people received critical WASH supplies and services in under resourced health centres, schools, closed institutions, and in the most marginalized communities. • Digital outreach on social media and via interactive web and mobile apps were significant innovations that influenced populations behaviours for COVID 19 prevention. Social listening tools helped gather feedback to define messages that resonated more effectively with target audiences. In 2020, UNICEF reached nearly 198 million people with messaging on COVID 19 prevention and access to services. • UNICEF helped ensure over 4.2 million people could access healthcare through community health workers and health facilities. Home visits by community nurses were transformed through digital and telephone outreach, while support to health systems ensured adequate infection prevention and control IPC measures, restoration of immunization, antenatal care and other mother child health services. • During the first nation wide lockdowns, school closures affected nearly 50 million children in 20 countries. While intensive support was provided to ensure safe school re openings, at the end of the year, 26.6 million children remain impacted by partial school closures. UNICEF supported 28.2 million children in distance home based learning. • Across ECAR, the socio economic impact is expected to increase poverty by 44 percent – equivalent to an additional 6.1 million children living in poverty. Initial support to countries in building more resilient social protection systems, included the introduction and strengthening of cash transfer programmes, reaching 9.7 million people. • In partnership with WHO and Gavi, UNICEF has been providing regional level technical support and ensuring country readiness for COVID 19 vaccine roll out through assessments of cold chains, supporting the development of national deployment and vaccination plans, facilitating the procurement of COVID 19 vaccines, and preparing evidence based communications campaigns to maximise vaccine uptake.",['Epidemic']
" The United Nations Development Programme UNDP and Islamic Relief Worldwide today announced a new partnership to boost food production, inject cash into the local economy and support female entrepreneurs in some of the poorest areas of Afghanistan. This US 22 million project will employ local communities to rehabilitate almost 200 agricultural irrigation systems by the end of the year – providing more than 158,000 families with the cash they need to buy food and other essentials while also stimulating local markets and improving long term farming productivity. The project will also create clusters of value chains by providing entrepreneurship skills, cash investment and creating market linkages for primarily women run businesses in the Northern region. Abdallah Al Dardari, Resident Representative of UNDP, said “From the onset of the crisis, UNDP asserted the importance of livelihoods as a community based strategy to save lives and revitalize the local economy. This project is not just about injecting much needed emergency cash and restoring the liquidity in the markets. It’s about paving the next steps towards access to larger markets, raw materials, and energy to ensure the project remains sustainable”. Umair Hasan, Afghanistan Country Director of Islamic Relief Worldwide, said “Millions of people in Afghanistan do not know how they will feed their children beyond today. They are doing all they can to survive, but the economy is collapsing. This partnership will provide vulnerable people with cash to buy food to keep their children alive and enable a better future for years to come. It will support long term development so that farmers can have sustainable livelihoods and women entrepreneurs can thrive and reach new markets.” In recent months, Afghanistan’s economy has collapsed, causing a massive liquidity crisis. Almost 23 million Afghans – more than half the population – are now suffering from critical food and cash shortages, and the situation is getting worse. Although food is available in local markets, most impoverished families do not have the cash to buy it. Agriculture is the most significant source of livelihood in Afghanistan, but most community irrigation systems have been damaged or destroyed by years of conflict. Local communities cannot farm productively as a result, but they cannot afford to make essential repairs. The new project will roll out in at least nine provinces that are worst affected by the current crisis, including Balkh, Bamyan, Faryab, Baghlan, Herat, Kandahar, Kunar, Kunduz and Nangarhar. More than 158,000 local labourers will receive cash for working to rehabilitate the irrigation systems. Unconditional cash payments will also be provided to 5,000 other vulnerable people, including people with disabilities, widows, and the elderly. The project will also support 1,200 micros, small or medium sized enterprises led or managed by women. It will provide them with 1,000 cash grants to help them develop their products and access new markets, and train them on business skills such as marketing, bookkeeping, and value chain integration.

"Mostak Hussain, Humanitarian Director for Save the Children in Bangladesh, said “This has been a devastating monsoon so far, and we’re only halfway through the season. The incessant rains have led to widespread flooding across the country, affecting some five million people, including 1.9 million children, according to the UN. More than one million homes have been damaged by the floods and dozens of people have died. “We are witnessing the longest lasting floods in Bangladesh in over two decades, with huge implications for the health and well being of children and families in low lying areas. Tens of thousands of latrines and wells are either damaged or destroyed, severely compromising access to safe drinking water and hygiene practices. Meanwhile, COVID 19 lockdown measures and the heavy rain means families – especially pregnant women – can’t access healthcare services when they need to. Millions of people who rely on the land to grow their food and earn a living, have lost everything as a third of Bangladesh is submerged. “This year, South Asia has already suffered two severe cyclonic storms in just a few weeks and the region is now witnessing one of the heaviest monsoons in years. The Bangladeshi government is acutely aware of extreme weather events and declared a ‘climate emergency’ last year. It is already supporting the affected communities but much more is needed to help protect vulnerable children and families from losing their homes and livelihoods every time there is an extreme weather event or the rivers burst their banks. We must make communities more resilient and able to adapt to the changing climate, because sadly this could be a way of life going forward.” ENDS.","['Epidemic', 'Flood', 'Land Slide']"

"COLOMBO, 28 June 2022 All schools in Sri Lanka’s Colombo region and in other major cities across the country have closed for two weeks after a nationwide fuel shortage prompted the government to rule that only essential services would operate until July 10. The government had already announced that schools in some areas would close for one week but the closures were extended on Monday. School principals and provincial education authorities are to decide how lessons are delivered to students with schools closed. Schools in other locations will function at the discretion of school heads and education officials. Save the Children said it was deeply concerned about the impact that the fourth school closure this year will have on Sri Lanka’s 4.2 million children whose education has already been impacted by years of disruptions due to COVID 19. Free school meals are also a lifeline for one million of the country’s most vulnerable children. Sri Lanka is facing its worst economic crisis since independence, with food security, agriculture, livelihoods, and access to health particularly affected. Many schools in Sri Lanka were closed for one and a half years during the height of the pandemic, but since they re opened at the start of 2022, they have closed multiple times as a result of the current crisis. A recent needs assessment by Save the Children showed that children from 2 out of 5 households were not able to continue their online learning with families unable to afford data. Many children also don’t have access to the internet with households on average only owning one mobile phone. Ranjan Weththasinghe, Save the Children’s Director of Programmes in Sri Lanka, said it was time for the international community to show solidarity with the people of Sri Lanka “Closing schools not only locks children out of education but often also robs them of the only decent meal they get each day. We know that 50 of families are really struggling to support their children’s education and some children are already dropping out of school and going hungry daily. Parents should not have to choose between buying data for online classes or buying food. “We’re at risk of taking a huge step backwards on child nutrition and education in Sri Lanka, which would be an absolute tragedy. This worsening economic crisis could impact Sri Lanka’s children for possibly years to come. Children are the future and their needs must be the priority.” The UN and humanitarian organisations are calling on donors to urgently provide life saving assistance to the women, men, and children most affected by the crisis to prevent the humanitarian situation deteriorating in the country. Save the Children Sri Lanka is implementing a ‘food for education’ program across 887 schools in seven districts in the country, many of which will be impacted by the latest closures. The project complements the government’s school meal program to improve children’s nutrition and reduce the dropout rate from schools across the country.","['Epidemic', 'Other']"
" Lausanne, Switzerland, 2 October 2018 Answering the call for international humanitarian assistance from the Indonesian government, Medair has decided to deploy its emergency response team. A team of five experienced emergency professionals will arrive on the ground in the next 48 hours. They will conduct rapid needs assessments and start responding to the most pressing needs. On 28 and 29 September, several earthquakes struck Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. With a magnitude of 7.5, the strongest earthquake toppled buildings and triggered a deadly and destructive tsunami. The tsunami hit land in Palu, a city home to about 350,000 people, at a speed of 800 kph, with waves of up to six metres high. Other areas along the coastline have been badly damaged and reports are still pending from the more remote areas. “The reports and footage of utter devastation are heart wrenching,” said William Anderson, Medair’s International Director. “So many people affected have lost loved ones in the last week and the needs for those who survived are immense and immediate.” Up to 1.5 million people are affected, with more than 1,200 people killed and around 48,000 people reported to be displaced from their homes. These numbers are expected to continue rising in the coming days as rescue workers continue searching the rubble. “It is a race against the clock. Many people are left displaced and the risk of disease outbreaks is looming. Food, water, shelter, health care, and cash assistance are urgently needed. We are facing severe access constraints but we are doing everything in our power to reach the worst hit, most remote communities on the island with urgent assistance,” said William. In its response, Medair will work together with key actors, including the local government and Integral Alliance partners.

Furthermore, the East Asia regional office partners with government and international agencies, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross ICRC , United Nations agencies, and other NGOs working in the countries were projects are implemented. font p font size 3 face sans serif Current context font p font size 2 face sans serif The East Asia region is made up of a very diverse population, facing diverse political and socio economic issues. The region stays on the headlines of the media with stories such as the ongoing six party talks in the DPRK and China's preparation for the 2008 Olympics. At the same time, the region is plagued with frequent natural disasters of massive magnitudes, extreme contradictions in wealth and social welfare, as well as the continuous potential threat of pandemics spreading in and beyond the region. font p font size 2 face sans serif While development is on the rise in the region, the World Bank estimates that 552 million of the world's 1.1 billion poor are living in East Asia. 1 Governments across the map are beginning to place more responsibility on humanitarian organizations to take on this challenge, often while reducing their funding on critical programmes. This puts a great strain on the Red Cross societies in the region, as they are trying to scale up their efforts in disaster management as well as health and care, while at the same time building their own organizational capacities. font p font size 2 face sans serif Some of the worst flooding in history hit various areas of both China and the DPRK in the past two years. Millions have been affected with long term implications of increased vulnerabilities. In 2007, both China and the DPRK launched emergency appeals with the support of the Federation, in order to meet the needs of the most vulnerable populations. At the same time, in other areas, severe drought, and extreme temperatures across the region have left millions without adequate water supplies or protection. font p font size 2 face sans serif The regional health context has also been complex and rapidly changing throughout these two years. The diversity of East Asia's countries in terms of demographics and socio economic development is reflected in the nature of the risks posed by HIV AIDS and the epidemiology in each of the five countries. HIV epidemic continues to affect the region and although there is some variation in estimation methodology introduced starting from 2007, the 92,000 21,000 220,000 adults and children estimated to be newly infected with HIV in East Asia in 2007 represent a significant increase over the 77,000 4,900 130,000 people who acquired HIV in 2001 2 . font p font size 2 face sans serif Besides disasters and the spread of diseases, ongoing rapid urbanization, population movements, population ageing and other broad social phenomena are having a collective impact on the nature and extent of health problems in the region. These, of course, change how disasters and diseases affect the populations, and ultimately affect how the Red Cross responds in each situation. font p font size 2 face sans serif During this time, the national societies have themselves been challenged with various constraints in their work, adequate funding being one of the major concerns for both Mongolia and China. For example, at the end of 2005, the DPRK government announced it intention to halt the work of humanitarian organizations and focus on development, rather than relief. Although the DPRK Red Cross and the Federation were able to negotiate a continued presence in the country, this resulted in a major reduction in the number of in country international delegates and increased the role of the regional delegation in supporting the work in the DPRK. font p font size 2 face sans serif b Notes b font p font size 2 face sans serif 1 East Asia and Pacific Update, April 2007 font p font size 2 face sans serif 2 UNAIDS WHO 2007 AIDS Epidemic Update font p font size 2 face sans serif b Contact information b font p font size 2 face sans serif For further information on this Appeal, contact font p font size 2 face sans serif Federation regional office in China Mr. Carl Naucler head of East Asia regional office carl.naucler ifrc.org phone 86.10.65327162, fax 86.10.65327166. font p font size 2 face sans serif Federation zone in Kuala Lumpur Mr. Jagan Chapagain deputy head of zone email jagan.chapagain ifrc.org phone 603 2161 0892 fax 603 2161 1210 font .","['Earthquake', 'Extratropical Cyclone', 'Flood', 'Tropical Cyclone']"
" The disaster response group, AKUT, pulled survivors from the rubble of last month's Aegean quake. Now, they're providing ongoing support to Turkey's displaced. By Talya Meyers On October 30, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake originating in the Aegean Sea ripped through the province of Izmir, in Turkey, causing widespread damage to the country’s third largest city. Immediately following the earthquake, a tsunami damaged parts of the coastline. At least 116 people were killed, and over 1,000 injured. According to the Turkish disaster response group, AKUT, more than 4,000 families have lost their homes. More than 80 camps were established to house those displaced. New aftershocks regularly shake the area, with more than 1,400 recorded thus far, AKUT reported. “Every day we have at least magnitude 3 earthquakes,” said Gülçin Güreşçi, the group’s CEO. And although some have found alternate housing or have been accommodated in local hotels, hundreds are still living in campsites facing ongoing displacement as winter falls on Turkey. In the aftermath of the quake, AKUT’s volunteers dug through the rubble, rescuing nine people along with several cats and dogs – and a rabbit, Güreşçi said. It’s no surprise. Originally founded by a small group of self sufficient mountain climbers, AKUT, a Turkish search and rescue and aid organization, has grown to approximately 3,000 volunteers accustomed to disaster response – and to providing ongoing and when the event is over. After participating in the rescue effort, AKUT’s next priority is to distribute much needed supplies to people displaced by the quake. To support AKUT in its ongoing response to the earthquake, Direct Relief is providing the organization with a 50,000 emergency grant, along with a donation of emergency medical backpacks designed to address a wide range of health issues in the field. Güreşçi’s biggest concern is those still living in camps, in close quarters amid the pandemic. To complicate matters, Turkey’s cold winter has begun. The group’s support will focus on children, those with disabilities or at high risk of Covid complications, vulnerable women led households, and Turkey’s large refugee population. The country currently hosts approximately 3.6 million Syrian refugees, along with hundreds of thousands from other nationalities. The Brookings Institute said that Turkey hosts more refugees than any other country in the world. According to AKUT, refugees are more likely to be afraid to ask for government or other support, due to their uncertain status. AKUT is working to distribute bags containing emergency supplies such as blankets and headlamps, along with masks, hand sanitizer, and first aid kit materials to those still displaced by the quake. With Direct Relief’s grant, the group anticipates that it will be able to reach approximately 2,000 people with support. In addition, the group is working to promote awareness of Covid 19 in the camps and to educate those staying there about safe practices such as handwashing and social distancing. Covid 19 and associated lockdowns have made it more complicated for AKUT to distribute aid, Güreşçi said. Although the organization has about 300 volunteers on the ground, they must move through the camps escorted and in small groups. Officials running the camps “want to see that we are protected from Covid and don’t have Covid to spread,” she explained. But Güreşçi said that the government has been responsive in providing housing, medical aid, and other support, and that community response has been strong as well. “People are kind in Izmir,” she said.",['Earthquake']
"SUMMARY OF FINDINGS A. WATER, SANITATION AND HYGIENE KEY FINDINGS 1 . Many communities cannot access safe water sources. An estimated 68 of the rainwater harvesting catchment structures are broken, 70 of the wells have been contaminated, and piped water systems have been damaged. Water quality is poor everywhere except Port Vila, resulting in a health risk. 2 . 68 of the sanitation superstructures have been destroyed, resulting in an increase in open defecation, which was reported to be up to 45 in some places. Open defecation presents urgent health, protection and dignity risks to children, women, and vulnerable groups. 3 . Only 30 of households report hand washing, posing a risk of communicable disease. Some bathing facilities are unsafe. KEY PRIORITIES 1 . Provide immediate access to water supply through emergency water distribution and restoration of water systems. 2 . Prevent the spread of diseases by providing hygiene messages, household water treatment and safe storage supplies and by ensuring household access to soap. 3 . Ensure privacy and safe disposal of human faeces by restoring sanitation structures, complemented with sanitation promotion. 4 . Ensure dignity and minimize protection risks by providing safe bathing facilities and access to sanitary protection materials for girls and women. 5 .

"Human Rights Council Forty sixth session 22 February–19 March 2021 Agenda item 2 Annual report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and reports of the Office of the High Commissioner and the Secretary General Summary The present report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights describes the human rights situation and the activities of her office in Honduras from 1 January to 31 December 2020. The report highlights key human rights advances and challenges in the promotion and protection of human rights, with a focus on population in a vulnerable situation and the human rights impact of the COVID 19 and hurricanes Eta and Iota. The report concludes with recommendations to various State institutions. I. Introduction 1. The present report is submitted pursuant to article V 4 of the agreement signed between the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights OHCHR and the Government of Honduras on 4 May 2015. The report is based on the information collected and analysed by OHCHR through in situ and remote human rights monitoring and information provided by state authorities. It also includes information provided by civil society, victims and other stakeholders. OHCHR thanks the State for its responses to requests for information. 2. Despite the impacts of the COVID 19 pandemic, OHCHR remained fully operational throughout the reporting period, continued to monitor the human rights situation in the country and provided technical assistance for the promotion and protection of human rights. OHCHR conducted 29 field missions and 17 missions to detention centres to monitor in situ the human rights situation in the country, in addition to the permanent remote monitoring. At least 105 cases of alleged violations against human rights defenders, including environmental and land defenders, were followed up and 10 trials of emblematic human rights cases were monitored. OHCHR developed advocacy strategies, 25 technical assistance and institutional strengthening processes addressed to State Institutions, and organized 16 capacity building workshops and trainings with the participation of different stakeholders. OHCHR also provided support to more than 350 civil society organizations. The Office launched 8 public media and advocacy campaigns and issued one thematic report, 15 press releases and 59 messages on social media. OHCHR also developed strategic partnerships and strengthened its collaboration with civil society organizations, the United Nations System, the National Human Rights Institution NHRI and State authorities, including in the Judicial, Legislative and Executive branches. The Office’s priorities included promoting the rule of law and accountability, citizen security and human rights, enhancing civic space, access to economic, social and cultural rights and equality and non discrimination. In light of the impacts of the COVID 19 pandemic and other humanitarian emergencies, OHCHR advocated for placing human rights at the heart of the Government response. II. Context 3. In 2020, Honduras continued to face important human rights challenges, including high levels of poverty, violence, impunity, discrimination and lack of access to economic, social and cultural rights. The COVID 19 pandemic and hurricanes Eta and Iota exacerbated this situation. 4. On 15 March 2020, in response to the first confirmed cases of COVID 19, the Government adopted Executive Decree PCM 21 2020 declaring a state of emergency. The Decree posed disproportionate restrictions to freedom of expression and allowed for detention without judicial review for a period of over twenty four hours. On 22 March 2020, the Government modified the decree in accordance with OHCHR’s recommendations, which emphasized that emergency measures need to be based on the principles of necessity, legality, proportionality, and non discrimination. 5. The state of emergency was regularly renewed and endorsed by the National Congress and remained in force as of 31 December 2020. Measures adopted by the Government in response to the pandemic included an absolute curfew allowing only essential movements and the closing of schools, universities, public offices and most private businesses. As of 1 June 2020, the police had reported 30,000 detentions for non compliance of the curfew. The lack of clear legal requirements for administrative arrest, as well as its widespread use, raise concern over the arbitrary nature of some of these detentions. 6. The National Anti Corruption Council and civil society organizations documented alleged irregularities in government procurement processes during the COVID 19 pandemic, allegedly facilitated by emergency regulations.1 According to a survey conducted in September 2020, 94 percent of the population believed that acts of corruption had occurred in the management of the pandemic.2 The Public Prosecutor’s Office is investigating3 alleged irregularities and corruption related to the purchase of seven mobile field hospitals. The exhaustive, impartial and independent investigation of these cases is fundamental to ensure transparency and reduce public distrust related to the Government’s response to the pandemic. 7. With a view to the 2021 general elections, OHCHR welcomes the adoption in 2020 of a legal framework aimed at increasing women’s participation and political representation. OHCHR is concerned that delays in the approval of the new electoral law, which would regulate the details of the upcoming electoral processes in March and November 2021, as well as the allocation of a dedicated budget for its implementation may affect the legitimacy and public acceptance of the results. This could lead to unrest. OHCHR emphasizes that the prompt adoption of an electoral law and the necessary protocols for its implementation that ensure the right to vote and stand for elections is needed to guarantee a transparent electoral process. 8. On 5 November 2020, the Human Rights Council examined Honduras during the third cycle of the Universal Periodic Review UPR .","['Epidemic', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Tropical Cyclone']"

" Shipments of medical aid to facilities like Murshid Hospital and Health Care Center in Karachi are supporting the country's health system After surviving extreme heat and severe rains, many in Pakistan have been displaced from their homes and now lack daily necessities like food and clothing. Non governmental organizations have distributed packages of food and clothing. The country’s government has also dispersed food while sending rescue teams to parts of the country that are now difficult to reach by land to save lives. However, Pakistani health experts say the larger issues of homelessness, famine, and climate change will haunt the country for years to come. Pakistan is more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than other countries based on its geographical location, although it emits fewer carbon emissions than most other countries. The United Nations reported that 33 million people have been affected by this year’s floods and it may take up to six months for the water to recede. Homes, schools, markets and more have all been washed away. Hundreds of thousands have lost their homes after a record breaking season of rainfall left nothing but debris behind. Pakistan’s monsoon season, which runs through the summer months, saw 243 above average rainfall in August alone, according to the Pakistani government. Over 1,100 people have died, and hundreds were injured from the severe weather. Just months before, the country experienced a drought with temperatures as high as 115 degrees in April. The weather affects not only the rainfall and rising waters across Pakistan, but crop yields for food and living conditions. Haamid Jaffer, from the Murshid Hospital and Health Care Center in Karachi, said that he worries about the millions who have been displaced and where they will live in the future. Murshid Hospital provides affordable healthcare services to low income communities and has received almost 12 million in financial and medical aid support from Direct Relief. Many families from flooded areas migrated north, leaving behind just one family member to claim any land that submerges from the wetland, according to Jaffer. He said there aren’t always formal and legally binding documents for proof of ownership. “They may want to protect that plot of land so that nobody else from the neighborhood nearby comes and encroaches,” he said. “The fear is always there.” Jaffer said that homelessness is a growing problem in Pakistan, which could result in psychiatric and psychological challenges later in life. Those who have had to relocate are living in a new community, may have to find new employment, and are potentially away from family and friends. Intense flooding can increase the risk of waterborne diseases like typhoid, malaria, and dengue. While there are vaccines to combat the illnesses, many young people in Pakistan remain unvaccinated due to cultural and religious beliefs, according to the National Library of Medicine. The severe heat can also cause dehydration, bacterial infections and skin diseases. Jaffer said that he also worries about family planning during times of crisis pregnant women who have had to leave their homes from the floods and likely are without consistent care throughout the duration of pregnancy, and that Murshid hospital has operated with an interest in improving maternal health for over a decade. Recent shipments contained prenatal vitamins and other medical support for the hospital treating those impacted by the floods. Since January 2022, Direct Relief has shipped more than 35 million worth of medical aid to Pakistan, which has been distributed to health facilities across the country. .","['Flash Flood', 'Flood']"

"The U.S. National Intelligence Council NIC has released a report identifying 20 humanitarian emergencies worldwide, affecting approximately 42 million people. quot Global Humanitarian Emergencies Trends and Projections, 2001 2002 quot predicts that the international community will continue to respond and provide aid to these countries, but that resources will remain below needs. br The total of 20 emergencies is an improvement over the previous year's finding of 25 humanitarian emergencies. Internal conflict, severe government repression, and natural disaster are some of the primary causes of the crises that have resulted in humanitarian emergencies, according to an introductory summary of the annual survey conducted by the NIC, a U.S. government strategic analysis group. In six other cases, countries have moved beyond conflicts or natural disasters, but are still facing critical humanitarian needs. p The 20 humanitarian emergencies identified in the report are in Afghanistan, Angola, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Burundi, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iraq, North Korea, Russia Chechnya, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Somalia, Sudan, Uganda, Tajikistan and Yugoslavia. p The global report ranks the situation in Afghanistan among the most serious, and likely to worsen. quot The humanitarian situation will continue to deteriorate due to a forecasted 1 million ton grain deficit, continued fighting between the Taliban and opposition forces, the Taliban's sporadic resistance to Western humanitarian programs, formidable logistic challenges, and donor fatigue, quot the report says. p The other most serious humanitarian emergency noted in the report are in Colombia, Iraq and North Korea. p The complete report is available at a href http www.cia.gov nic pubs other 5Fproducts global 5Fhumanitarian 5Fpub.htm http www.cia.gov nic pubs other 5Fproducts global 5Fhumanitarian 5Fpub.htm a p Following is the summary of the NIC report p begin text p b NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE COUNCIL br Global Humanitarian Emergencies Trends and Projections, 2001 2002 b p b Scope Notes b p This assessment focuses on humanitarian emergencies arising from manmade causes and major natural disasters. We do not address situations in which the need for development assistance or food aid is due primarily to chronic poverty or environmental degradation. p In this assessment quot humanitarian emergencies quot are defined as situations in which at least 300,000 civilians require international humanitarian assistance to avoid serious malnutrition or death. Our definition includes those situations in which people need protection in order to facilitate access to humanitarian aid. p The manmade causes we focus on primarily are armed, typically internal, conflict and repressive government policies. Secondarily, we note sudden economic emergencies and major technological occurrences, such as a nuclear power plant meltdown, as potential causes of humanitarian emergencies. p All these situations can be exacerbated by sudden or persistent natural disasters or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases. p The timeframe for this assessment is through December 2002. p b Summary b p The capacity and willingness of the international community to respond to humanitarian emergencies will continue to be stretched through December 2002. The overall number of people in need of emergency humanitarian assistance now approximately 42 million is likely to increase p Five ongoing emergencies in Afghanistan, Burundi, Colombia, North Korea and Sudan cause almost 20 million people to be in need of humanitarian assistance as internally displaced persons IDPs , refugees, or others in need in their home locations. All these emergencies show signs of worsening through 2002. p In addition, humanitarian conditions may further deteriorate in populous countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo DROC or Indonesia. p The total number of humanitarian emergencies 20 is down from 25 in January 2000. Of the current emergencies p Eleven are in countries experiencing internal conflict Afghanistan, Angola, Burundi, Colombia, DROC, Indonesia, Russia Chechnya, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Sudan, and Uganda. p Two in Iraq and North Korea are due largely to severe government repression. p The remaining six in Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Yugoslavia are humanitarian emergencies that have entered the transitional stage beyond prolonged conflict, repressive government policies, and or major natural disasters. p The primary cause of the emergency in Tajikistan is drought. Several other countries currently experiencing humanitarian emergencies Afghanistan, Eritrea, Ethiopia, North Korea, Somalia, and Sudan also are affected by major, persistent natural disasters. p b Current Emergencies of Greatest Concern b p Four countries are of greatest concern because of the scale and persistence of their humanitarian emergencies their significant impact upon continuing strategic interests of major outside powers, including the United States and their importance for stability in their regions. p In Afghanistan, the humanitarian situation, already serious, is likely to worsen. Millions of people are at risk of famine as a result of a three year long drought and fighting, which has already forced some 3.6 million Afghans to flee to Pakistan and Iran. The humanitarian situation will continue to deteriorate due to a forecasted 1 million ton grain deficit, continued fighting between the Taliban and opposition forces, the Taliban's sporadic resistance to Western humanitarian programs, formidable logistic challenges, and donor fatigue. p In Colombia, additional IDPs internally displaced persons on the order of thousands per month are adding to the existing roughly 1.5 million internally displaced persons. Attacks on civilians are likely to continue unabated and will likely increase, as paramilitary and insurgent groups fight for territory and control of the country's resources. Conditions are likely to deteriorate as a result of the absence of strong national programs to provide sustained assistance and the reticence of most international donors to provide funds. p Conditions in central and southern Iraq are unlikely to improve due to continued manipulation of the UN oil for food program by the government for political gain. Humanitarian conditions in central and southern Iraq will degenerate to the extent that Saddam Husayn exercises greater control over oil revenues. Conditions in northern Iraq are likely to continue to improve because UN management of the aid program will help ease the impact of any disruptions caused by Baghdad. p North Korea will remain a significant humanitarian challenge due to the severity of the food deficit, restricted international access to those in need, its collapsed economy and weakened infrastructure, its exposure to frequent major natural disasters both drought and flooding and the large number of people affected. Over eight million people more than one third of the country's population are in need of food aid. Absent significant economic reform, North Korea will continue to depend on large scale humanitarian aid, the bulk of which will be provided by the United States, South Korea, Japan and China through 2002. p b Other Current Emergencies b p Other current humanitarian emergencies are of concern because of the scale and projected outlook for the crisis, as well as the likelihood that the emergency will spread and destabilize neighboring countries and regions. p Humanitarian conditions in Burundi, Sudan, and Tajikistan are likely to deteriorate further. p We expect current conditions in Angola, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sri Lanka, and Uganda either to remain about the same or deteriorate somewhat. p Humanitarian concerns in Azerbaijan, Russia's Chechnya region, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Indonesia are likely to remain at or near current levels. p b Sub Saharan Africa Region at Risk b p Sub Saharan Africa is the region at greatest risk of a major new or significantly worse humanitarian emergency through December 2002. Most of Sub Saharan Africa suffers from abject poverty, intense ethnic rivalries, and grossly inadequate communications and transportation infrastructure conditions that make the region especially vulnerable to humanitarian emergencies and hinder response efforts. Genocidal conflicts aimed at annihilating all or part of a racial, religious, or ethnic group, and conflicts caused by other crimes against humanity such as forced, large scale expulsions of populations are particularly likely to generate massive and intractable humanitarian needs. p In Yugoslavia's Kosovo region conditions among the ethnic Albanian majority are likely to improve, but conditions for Serb and Roma minorities may deteriorate. p Conditions are likely to improve in the Republic of Serbia outside of Kosovo. p b Potential Emergencies b p Through 2002, seven potential emergencies are of greatest concern. We list them in order of their probability of developing. p An escalation of ethnic tensions leading to full scale civil war in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia would destabilize southeastern Europe by displacing tens of thousands of Slav Macedonians and sending hundreds of thousands of mostly ethnic Albanian refugees into neighboring countries. p In Zimbabwe, food shortages and political violence fueled by high inflation, unemployment, racial tensions and land reform issues in the run up to the winter 2002 election could precipitate a humanitarian crisis by spring 2002, causing refugee flows into South Africa and elsewhere in southern Africa. p In Haiti, continuing economic stagnation, political stalemate, and internal unrest, if left unchecked, will raise political tensions. A severe economic downturn and a resurgence of serious human rights violations would lead to a renewed outflow of thousands of people. p Kenya already suffering one of its most serious droughts in a half century faces rising political and ethnic tensions in the run up to presidential elections in December 2002, which could prompt large scale refugee flows. Because much of the humanitarian aid to Sudan and the Great Lakes region in Central Africa passes through the Kenyan port of Mombasa, instability in Kenya and any resulting deterioration of the infrastructure would affect the delivery of humanitarian aid throughout the region. p Tens of thousands of economic migrants and foreign workers are likely to flee Côte d'Ivoire in the coming months if the government resorts to xenophobia as a tool to discredit its primary opposition, much of whose support comes from immigrants and Muslims. p A renewed conflict between nuclear powers India and Pakistan over Kashmir could expand into a full scale war, displacing over a million people. The potential scale of a humanitarian emergency would be even greater in the unlikely event of a nuclear exchange. p The probability of a humanitarian emergency in Nigeria is low through December 2002, but the impact of such an emergency would be significant. The country's challenges include poor economic performance and ethnic instability. p b Humanitarian Response b p We judge that major donor countries will continue to respond quickly and provide substantial amounts of humanitarian aid in short term emergencies resulting from natural disasters and in severe new emergencies caused by conflict or government repression. Funding for humanitarian aid in long lasting crises, including many in Africa, will, however, continue to fall well short of targeted needs unless signs of achieving a settlement emerge. p The ability and willingness of Western donor countries to provide humanitarian aid will be constrained somewhat if the global economic slowdown worsens. p Consensual humanitarian responses will continue to be substantially more numerous than forceful humanitarian interventions against the will of a local government or local combatants. Government and international humanitarian agencies and nongovernmental organizations NGOs often will attempt to deliver relief to civilian groups at risk, but many governments will continue to be highly wary of forceful humanitarian interventions p Major Western donor countries will increasingly invest in a range of conflict prevention efforts as well as political and economic initiatives in post conflict settings, rather than deploying military forces during the course of a conflict. p Despite some improvement in the responsiveness and capacity of humanitarian agencies in recent years, limits imposed by budgetary constraints and bureaucratic competition among the major UN agencies and international NGOs as well as the problems associated with operating in conflict situations will continue to hamper the effective delivery of humanitarian assistance. p In the absence of adequate security, an increasing number of UN agencies, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and NGOs nongovernmental organizations will withdraw, at least temporarily, from particularly dangerous humanitarian operations. p end text p i Distributed by the Office of International Information Programs, U.S. Department of State.

ACT Philippines Forum was barely organized when Typhoon Haiyan struck. The humanitarian work was an acid test. But more than that, it showed ACT Philippines Forum where and how it “will lay its treasures” in the coming years. It directed the Forum to appreciate more fully its reason for being.

"On 26 December 2004, an earthquake in the Indian Ocean triggered a tsunami that devastated India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Aceh. Over a quarter of a million people were killed and 1.5 million made homeless. Caritas launched a half a billion dollar programme, providing emergency assistance to over a million people, built permanent houses for 33,000 families and helped provide livelihoods for over 85,000 people. Hardest hit was the Indonesian province of Aceh. A decade later, Caritas caught up with some of the people and programmes it supported. Boat on roof Over 160,000 people died in Aceh alone. Caritas provided emergency assistance to 250,000 people. International aid efforts in total saw the construction of 140,000 homes, 1,759 school buildings and 363 bridges. The World Bank described it as “the most successful reconstruction effort”. Monument The tsunami sparked peace talks that led to a deal in 2005 between separatist rebels and Jakarta, ending a three decade war that killed over 15,000 people. “The international relief effort helped speed up the end to the conflict. It gave us hope,” said former rebel, Buyung Arta. Rena “We ran towards higher ground. Just behind us two people were running but got caught in the wave. We never saw them again,” said Rena, who was 14 at the time. Rena continued her education and is now helping her family with their fishing business. “Take life as it is and run with it,” is her advice. Abas Caritas supported the fishing village of Kreung Raya with new equipment including motors for their boats and stalls to dry their catch. “We have new roads so we can go to market now and get a better price for the fish. We have a better house,” said Abas, one of the fishermen. Hospital Caritas members provided health and psychosocial support to 700,000 people. Catholic Relief Service helped rebuild and expand the Rsia Aceh Mother and Child Hospital in Banda Aceh. From 30 beds and it now has 110. In 2004, there was no medical centre devoted to mothers and children, now child mortality rates are in line with the Millennium Development Goals. School Caritas supported 350 infrastructure projects such as schools, clinics, roads and markets. One of them was the YKA kindergarten school in Banda Aceh. Only 30 children out of 600 returned after the tsunami and 17 out of 60 teachers were killed. It reopened in 2008 and is recognised as one of the best schools in the city, known for teaching diversity and welcoming both rich and poor families.","['Earthquake', 'Tsunami']"
" At least one million children in danger of violence as crisis intensifies in Lebanon – UN Findings released as the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General on Violence Against Children visits Lebanon Beirut, 17 December 2021 – One in two children in Lebanon is at serious risk of physical, emotional, or sexual violence, as families struggle to cope in the country’s deepening crisis, according to a new report from UNICEF. ‘Violent beginnings Children growing up in Lebanon’s crisis’ report also details that around 1.8 million children more than 80 per cent are now experiencing multidimensional poverty – up from around 900,000 in 2019 and risk being forced into abuses such as child labour or child marriage to help their families make ends meet. The report is released as the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General on Violence Against Children visits Lebanon. “Lebanon’s crisis threatens the present and the future of millions of children. Ensuring their protection from abuse, harm, and violence and safeguarding their rights are needed more than ever”, emphasized the Special Representative of the Secretary General SRSG on Violence against Children, Dr. Najat Maalla M’jid. Lebanon is reeling from the impact of national financial and political turmoil, the COVID 19 pandemic, and the aftermath of the August 2020 Beirut Port explosions. The report shows that the number of cases of child abuse and exploitation handled by UNICEF and partners shot up by almost half 44 per cent between October 2020 and October 2021, from 3,913 to 5,621 cases. It also outlines a series of growing threats to children’s safety Child labour is on the rise, with more than half 53 per cent of respondents to a UNICEF survey of partner organisations noting child labour as their number one protection concern, up from 41 per cent three months previously. In an October survey, 12 per cent of families questioned said that they sent at least one child to work, up from 9 per cent six months previously. Children as young as six are now working on farms, on the streets and illegally selling fuel, putting them at risk of serious burns and even death. Young girls risk being married off by desperate families who are seeking dowries. One in five Syrian girls between the ages of 15 19 in Lebanon is married. Civil society organisations are reporting a rise in cases of domestic violence. The proportion of Lebanese girls and women seeking services for gender based violence rose sharply in the past three years from 21 per cent of total cases in 2018, to 26 per cent in 2019, to 35 per cent in 2020 . Mental health issues are rising among young people. A UNICEF assessment that interviewed adolescents aged 15 to 24 in September 2021 shows that one in four reported often feeling depressed. As families face destitution, experts fear the number of children ending up separated from extended family and in residential care could increase. Growing numbers of children are coming into contact with the criminal justice system after participating in protests, falling victim to violence, or being pushed into crime as a means to survive. New threats to children are being documented as families become increasingly desperate including destitute families abandoning babies in the streets and children facing increased risk of abduction. “Investing in children’s protection, development and wellbeing cannot wait. Investing in children is essential for building an inclusive, peaceful, just and resilient society that keeps children safe from harm and leaves no one behind”, added the SRSG on Violence against Children. “Children’s safety and wellbeing are intricately connected to every pillar of a well functioning society,” said Yukie Mokuo, UNICEF Lebanon Representative. “It takes a village food, housing, healthcare, regular schooling, thriving families and functioning social services and institutions to help children grow up free from harm. When society begins to crumble, children are left extremely vulnerable to abuse, violence and exploitation.” The United Nations in Lebanon is working on protecting children from violence, abuse, and exploitation by reducing poverty revising laws and policies improving access to social welfare services, education and healthcare and working with the Government to strengthen protection services. In parallel, extensive efforts are being made to address the social norms that normalise violence against children and make it culturally accepted. “We must not fail the children of Lebanon. They are the future of Lebanon, the country’s hope,” said United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Lebanon, Ms. Najat Rochdi. “The shocking figures of children subject to abuse and exploitation, and deprived of their basic rights, must be reversed. No children in Lebanon, irrespective of their nationality, should be deprived of their basic rights to health, food, education, and protection. They must be at the forefront of the Government’s recovery plans, policies and practice,” she asserted. The UN is calling for a cohesive national response to prioritize the protection of children, involving a range of Government departments, UN agencies, civil society organizations, academics, and faith based leaders. Urgent support is also required from donors to safeguard vital programming for the most vulnerable children.

" 1. Brief description of the emergency and impact Pakistan is still facing an emergency situation following the devastating floods of 2010 and 2011. Sindh was the most affected province where monsoon rains overwhelmed 22 out of 23 districts. According to National Disaster Management Authority NDMA , the monsoon rains affected over 10 million people, more than half of whom were women, in Sindh alone. Particularly worrying due to Pakistan’s dire financial situation, is the fact that standing crops on 10 million acres of land out of the total 14.2 million acres of fertile land in Sindh Province were totally devastated.1 The floods caused an estimated loss of 7 billion to Pakistan’s agrarian economy as over 2.5 million bales of cotton, 2 million tons of rice, 4 million tons of sugarcane and several other small crops have been destroyed. Furthermore, the loss of livestock was substantial, with approximately 0.1 million head of cattle reportedly perished in the floods. The social amenities, civic and communication facilities such as phone, electricity, transportation etc. were suspended in most of the flood affected districts of Sindh. 2. Why is an ACT response needed The total population reached by the forum by 29 February 2012 in previous ACT Appeal PAK111 , amounted to approximately 10,824 households who received food, non food items, winterization kits, access to mobile medical camps and village cleaning kits. It was also able to distribute shelter kits to 2,195 households. With the very limited funding received for the ACT appeal PAK111 to assist the most vulnerable affected following the floods in 2011, the majority of the affected population have still not recovered from the emergency. With the uncharacteristically hot summer and the threat of the upcoming monsoon season, it is imperative that immediate early recovery assistance be provided to save lives.","['Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Mud Slide']"
"SC 14737 SECURITY COUNCIL 8931ST MEETING AM While noting certain progress in the implementation of South Sudan’s Revitalized Peace Agreement, officials told the Security Council today that a flagging constitutional process, inadequate aid funding and persistent security, humanitarian and environmental challenges are threatening the sustainability of the peace process overall. Nicholas Haysom, the Secretary‑General’s Special Representative for South Sudan and Head of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan UNMISS , presented the latest report on the situation document S 2021 1015 https undocs.org S 2021 1015 and outlined several positive developments in the implementation of the Revitalized Peace Agreement. The first high‑level meeting of all members of Government since that agreement was signed in 2018 concluded on 29 November, parliamentary appointments have continued and the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, has reconstituted and appointed members of nine state assemblies. Further, the country’s Council of Ministers has adopted legislation that — once approved by South Sudan’s Parliament — will guide the permanent Constitution‑making process and pave the way for elections. While he welcomed these steps, he stressed that “they are not sufficient if the peace process is to be sustained”. He expressed concern over restrictions on the civic space in advance of elections planned for 2023, and over the slow operationalization of the country’s Parliament that threatens to delay critical legislation that would facilitate Constitution‑making and electoral preparations. Turning to civilian protection, he underscored that “the Mission is doing all that it can” to support the Government in this responsibility, including through the flexible deployment of temporary operating bases that enable rapid humanitarian assistance, stabilization and security for returning displaced persons. He added that the Mission is also working to address climate related security risks, given the increasing frequency of droughts and severe floods in South Sudan. Wafaa Saeed, the Director of the Coordination Division of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, also briefing the Council, pointed out that the humanitarian situation in South Sudan has deteriorated since September. The country is facing its highest levels of food insecurity since it gained independence in 2011 and, between April and July, 7.2 million people were estimated to be in a crisis phase, of which 2.4 million were in an emergency phase. Further, increased food insecurity, illness and poor access to clean water, hygiene and sanitation are heightening malnutrition levels among children under the age of five, with about 1.4 million estimated to be acutely malnourished and in need of treatment in 2021 — the highest number since 2013. Noting that South Sudan remains among the most dangerous places in the world for aid workers, she detailed conflict and violence directed at such individuals and their assets, as well as the operational interference, bureaucratic impediments and physical‑access challenges impacting the humanitarian response. Turning to funding, she warned that the scope and scale of humanitarian needs and challenges are “outstripping our ability to adequately respond”. While the 2021 South Sudan Humanitarian Response Plan is funded at about 68 per cent, many sectors — such as health, nutrition, protection, water, sanitation and hygiene — are severely underfunded. More is needed, by more donors, to provide early funding for the 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan, which requires 1.7 billion to support the 8.4 million people in need. Also briefing the Council was Hai Anh Pham Viet Nam , speaking on behalf of the Chair of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 2206 2015 concerning South Sudan, who provided an overview of the Committee’s 2021 activities. These included the Chair’s visit to South Sudan from 16 to 20 November, during which the Chair and his delegation met with varied stakeholders concerning the implementation of the Revitalized Agreement. Turning to the arms embargo, he noted that the Committee received one exemption request in 2021, which was granted. In the ensuing discussion, many Council members expressed concern over slow implementation of the Revitalized Agreement, stating that this inertia has led to an increase in subnational violence that further frustrates efforts to address a dire humanitarian situation. Some speakers, underlining the importance of establishing transitional security arrangements and the Constitutional framework for upcoming elections, called on the international community to provide resources and capacity‑building assistance to the Government towards these ends. While several members stressed that the Government must protect the civic space and address human‑rights violations, still others drew attention to positive developments in the peace process, urged those present to support efforts to negotiate rather than engage in finger pointing and called on the Council to reconsider sanctions measures. The representative of the United Kingdom was among the speakers stressing that slow implementation of the Revitalized Agreement has grave consequences for ordinary South Sudanese, calling for the country’s leaders to redouble their efforts towards this end in 2022. He also joined other delegates in refuting the argument that the arms embargo is responsible for the lengthy delays in graduating the Necessary Unified Forces, recalling that an exemptions procedure remains in place for the Government’s legitimate security needs. The representative of the Russian Federation, underlining the importance of swiftly establishing such unified forces, echoed others’ concerns over ongoing clashes between Government forces and opposition groups and over reports of sporadic intercommunal conflict. Welcoming positive developments in other areas, however, she called for reconsideration of the sanctions regime against South Sudan as the country normalizes. The representative of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, also speaking for Kenya, Niger and Tunisia, similarly urged the consideration of lifting sanctions measures given the circumstances surrounding the pandemic. She further stressed that security challenges cannot be delinked from prevailing socioeconomic and humanitarian difficulties in the country, which have been exacerbated by COVID‑19 and the adverse effects of climate change. Viet Nam’s representative, speaking in his national capacity, pointed out that, despite remaining challenges, South Sudan is one of the African nations on the Council’s agenda with overall positive developments in the past two years. He concurred with other speakers, however, that the country’s increasing economic and humanitarian challenges must be addressed as over half the population is affected by food insecurity. It is important that the sanctions regime be regularly reviewed, he added. Addressing the Council, the representative of South Sudan stressed that implementation of the Revitalized Agreement has been “slow, but steady”. While widespread intra‑ and intercommunal conflict continues, such conflict has started to decline since the formation of state governments. Noting the displacement and suffering caused by droughts and floods in his country, he called on the international community to assist the Government with both addressing the immediate needs of affected populations and implementing long‑term adaptation and mitigation measures. Also underscoring that the Revitalized Agreement’s financial weight is too heavy for the parties thereto to bear alone, he called on the Council and the international community to “stop sitting on the fence, cherry‑picking”. “Let’s put our money where our mouths are”, he urged. Also speaking were representatives of the United States, Ireland, Mexico, India, Estonia, France, Norway and China. The meeting began at 10 08 a.m. and ended at 11 45 a.m. Briefings NICHOLAS HAYSOM, Special Representative of the Secretary‑General and Head of the United Nations Mission in South Sudan UNMISS , briefed the Council that, on 29 November, the country concluded its fifth National Governors Forum, which marked the first high level meeting of all members of Government since the signing of the peace agreement in 2018. Additionally, parliamentary appointments have continued and, by December, the President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, had reconstituted and appointed members of nine state assemblies. He also welcomed the adoption of legislation by the Council of Ministers that — once approved by South Sudan’s Parliament — will guide the permanent Constitution making process, which is a prerequisite for elections. He also pointed out that, on 4 November, the Government held its first ever interactive dialogue with the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. However, while he welcomed such steps to implement the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan, he stressed that “they are not sufficient if the peace process is to be sustained”. The failure of parties to reach an agreement on command ratios has promoted a fracturing of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement in Opposition, and mediation efforts that began in Khartoum have been undermined by the political crisis in Sudan. He underlined that the Government bears a special responsibility to establish the Necessary Unified Forces, which is but an initial step in the complex, essential process of constructing a national army that serves the nation’s interests. On that point, he reported that, following his meeting on 8 December with the President, funds have been released to the Joint Defence Board for screening soldiers at training centres preliminary to graduation of unified forces. Delivery of food and medicines has also commenced. Noting the President’s announcement that elections will be held in 2023, he stressed that 2022 will require both technical and political preparation towards that end, including an agreement on the Constitution and the rules governing the election. Expressing concern over restrictions on the civic space, he urged the Government to promote the fundamental human rights of all South Sudanese — including freedom of expression — to create a platform for democratic dialogue in a free, fair electoral process. He also expressed concern over the slow operationalization of the country’s Parliament, which threatens to delay critical legislation to facilitate Constitution‑making, election preparations, the establishment of national justice institutions, budget adoption and public financial reforms. For its part, UNMISS has already intensified support for legislative and Constitution‑making processes. Turning to the protection of civilians, he noted that the permanent ceasefire is holding and, partly because of UNMISS, the number of civilian casualties attributed to localized violence has roughly halved in 2021 relative to 2020. “The Mission is doing all that it can”, he said, to support the Government in its primary responsibility to protect civilians, including through the flexible deployment of temporary operating bases. These bases enable UNMISS to rapidly deploy to hotspots for conflict resolution and create conditions for the provision of humanitarian assistance, provide a stabilizing environment where peace has been elusive or provide a security umbrella for the safe and dignified return of displaced people. Highlighting that the increasing frequency of droughts and severe floods demonstrate South Sudan’s high vulnerability to climate change, he reported that a newly established UNMISS working group will develop integrated strategies to address these climate‑related security risks. WAFAA SAEED, Director of the Coordination Division, United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, reported that since September, the humanitarian situation in South Sudan has deteriorated. The country has faced the highest levels of food insecurity since its independence in 2011. At the height of the lean season between April and July, 7.2 million people were estimated to be in a crisis phase, of which 2.4 million were in an emergency phase. About 108,000 people in Akobo, Pibor, Aweil South, Tonj East, Tonj North and Tonj South counties faced catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity. In five of these locations, conflict was the major driver of displacement leading to the loss of lives, assets and livelihoods. Increased food insecurity, illness and poor access to clean water, hygiene and sanitation heightened malnutrition levels among children under the age of five. About 1.4 million children in that group and 480,000 pregnant or lactating women were estimated to be acutely malnourished and in need of treatment in 2021, the highest number since 2013. Conflict and violence directed at aid workers and their assets, operational interference, bureaucratic impediments and physical access challenges continue to impact the humanitarian response, she noted, highlighting that South Sudan remains among the most dangerous places in the world for aid workers. After several days of violence in Leer, Unity State, a nutrition aid worker was killed a few days ago, bringing the total number of aid workers killed in 2021 to four. UNMISS facilitated humanitarian access through long‑range patrols and the setting up of temporary operating bases in several locations. The delivery of adequate basic services is vital to sustain livelihoods, strengthen resilience and enable conditions for those who wish to return to their areas of origin. However, for many of the now 2 million displaced persons, return may not be an option. Those sites may become permanent urban or suburban settlements for many of them, including in former protection of civilian sites, such as Bentiu and Malakal. This needs to be recognized and steps should be taken to support people wherever they choose to stay. Long‑term planning will be required to address this new phenomenon. Turning to funding, she warned that the scope and scale of the humanitarian needs and the challenges are “outstripping our ability to adequately respond”. Although the 2021 South Sudan Humanitarian Response Plan is funded at about 68 per cent, this belies the fact that many sectors such as health, nutrition, protection, water, sanitation and hygiene are severely underfunded. Pooled fund mechanisms are playing an essential role, with 35 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund and 69 million from the South Sudan Humanitarian Fund provided in 2021. More is needed by more donors to provide early funding to the 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan, which requires 1.7 billion to support 8.4 million people in need. Reiterating three key actions, she said adequate, and early funding is required to sustain the gains made so far, particularly in averting catastrophic food insecurity levels. Government and non‑State actors need to abide by their obligation to facilitate safe and unhindered access and to protect aid workers. Lastly, the implementation of the peace process remains slow, and violence continues to erupt. All actors with influence must work to ensure the protection of civilians across South Sudan, she stressed. HAI ANH PHAM Viet Nam , speaking on behalf of the Chair of the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 2206 2015 concerning South Sudan, briefed the 15 member organ about the Committee’s activities in 2021, including the Chair’s visit to South Sudan in mid‑November. He reported that the Committee has met in‑person three times for informal consultations, and has also met thrice in closed video teleconferences. On 29 January, the Committee met for a closed video teleconference to hear a presentation by the Panel of Experts on its interim report document S 2020 1141 https undocs.org S 2020 1141 , and was briefed on 26 February by the Special Representative of the Secretary‑General on Sexual Violence in Conflict. On 26 March, in a closed video teleconference, the Committee heard a presentation by the Panel of Experts on its final report document S 2021 365 http undocs.org S 2021 365 and discussed its recommendations. On 18 June, the Committee met in person to hear a presentation by the Panel of Experts on its final report in a meeting open to South Sudan and regional States. On 15 October, during informal consultations, the Committee was briefed by the Special Representative of the Secretary‑General for Children and Armed Conflict, and it was briefed on 2 December, during informal consultations, by the Chair on his most recent visit to South Sudan, which took place from 16 to 20 November. During this visit, the Chair and his delegation met with stakeholders including South Sudan President Salva Kiir, representatives of UNMISS, diplomatic missions and civil society representatives, including women’s groups and religious leaders, both in Juba and Wau, with discussions primarily focussed on implementing the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan. Turning to the arms embargo, he said that during 2021, the Committee received one exemption request to the arms embargo, which was granted. Also, two exemptions requests were received concerning the travel ban and asset freeze measures, all of which were granted. Statements LINDA THOMAS GREENFIELD United States said catastrophic floods in South Sudan have endangered over 850,000 people, paired with food insecurity and other issues, creating a dire humanitarian situation. She encouraged the international community to address gaps in funding and resources, and actors at the national and subnational levels to facilitate humanitarian access and protect aid workers. Voicing concern over subnational violence in several regions, she cited looting and mass displacement, human rights abuses and killings based on ethnicity. With reports of murder and mutilation of pregnant women, elderly people and civilian captives, she called on the Government of South Sudan to hold perpetrators responsible and protect civilians, humanitarian and development workers, journalists and displaced persons. Targeting of civil society discourages participation, including preparation for elections. Noting it has been over three years since the peace agreement was signed, with progress slow, she urged the Government to swiftly implement a constitutional drafting process, transitional security and other measures to ensure free and fair elections in 2023 that reflect the wishes of all South Sudanese. She stressed that arms embargo provisions are not responsible for the lack of training of necessary unified forces — they are intended to create space for the peace process. That embargo helps protect civilians, and if the Government requires arms, clear exemption procedures are in place. She noted the Committee only received one request in 2021, which was granted. INGA RHONDA KING Saint Vincent and the Grenadines , speaking also on behalf of Kenya, Niger and Tunisia, noted the promising advances on the political front in South Sudan, and urged all relevant stakeholders to continue with the full implementation of the Revitalized Agreement. She underscored the importance of the principle of inclusivity in representation in governance institutions, including the minimum 35 per cent quota for women’s participation, along with youth representation. Commending the permanent ceasefire which continues to hold in the country, she also noted worrying incidents of ethnic and intercommunal clashes in some parts of the country and tensions amongst factions of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement Army in Opposition. Stressing the importance for the security measures to be strengthened and enhanced, she pointed out that security challenges cannot be delinked from the prevailing socioeconomic and humanitarian difficulties, which has been exacerbated by COVID‑19 and the adverse effects of climate change. Also calling for full respect of international law, and compliance with the status of force agreement, she urged consideration on the lifting of all sanctions and other unilateral coercive measures in light of COVID‑19. Turning to transitional justice arrangements, she noted that the country bloc is satisfied that the South Sudan Cabinet approved the establishment of the Hybrid Court. Establishment of truth‑seeking mechanisms and providing reparations for victims will help to reconcile and unite the South Sudanese people, she noted. Stressing the importance of continued engagement and support of the international community, regional organizations and South Sudanese partners, she stressed that Government holds the primary responsibility for protecting civilians. GERALDINE BYRNE NASON Ireland recalling the recent visit of the Committee to South Sudan, said that the main message relayed by interlocutors at all levels is that implementation of the peace agreement has been too slow. This has led to an increase in subnational violence, an impaired security apparatus, impunity around conflict‑related sexual violence, serious human rights violations including extrajudicial executions, facilitated by a lack of sufficiently robust accountability mechanisms and inadequate supports for survivors. It also compounds efforts to address an already dire humanitarian situation, exacerbated by record levels of flooding. Ireland has contributed to efforts to strengthen United Nations capacity to address these security risks in South Sudan through support for the Climate Security Mechanism. She highlighted that the holding of inclusive and democratic elections in South Sudan is a welcome prospect. The reconstitution of the National Legislative Assembly is a positive step, however its inaction to date has been a disappointment, she noted. JUAN GÓMEZ ROBLEDO VERDUZCO Mexico underscored the need to progress the implementation of the Revitalized Agreement, which “to date has been minimal and selective”. He called on South Sudan’s Government to expedite efforts towards this end — especially in the areas of security, disarmament, demobilization and reintegration — and to adopt legislation disbursing the resources necessary to affect such measures. Attempting to justify delays in implementing the Agreement as consequences of the arms embargo calls into question the Government’s sincerity in this regard. Noting that South Sudan is prone to sudden, constant floods — affecting almost 850,000 in 2021 — he stressed that the magnitude of these phenomena will prevent the country’s recovery before its next rainy season. This will have a domino effect on internal displacement, food insecurity and disease, which will, in turn, exacerbate tensions and clashes between communities. Against that backdrop, he expressed alarm over increasing incidents relating to access for humanitarian assistance, and urged authorities to guarantee security and unfettered access for humanitarian personnel. He also demanded that authorities respect the human‑rights standards and norms contained in the international instruments to which South Sudan is a party. RAVINDRA RAGUTTAHALLI India noted progress over the past three months, including adoption of the Constitution Making Process Bill and appointment of new members of the Transitional National Legislature Assembly. Political violence has decreased and the parties have been largely faithful to the Revitalized Agreement, with a stable economic situation. Last month’s visit by the 2206 Committee revealed positive progress, he said, including increased economic activity in Juba. The end goal remains free, fair and credible elections. While the ceasefire continues to hold, localized violence persists, though it has decreased by 53 per cent compared to 2020. Violence underlines the importance of early establishment of the Unified Command of the military and graduation of the Necessary Unified Forces. He emphasized that implementation of transitional security arrangements remains critical for the electoral process. Citing the humanitarian situation impacted by recent floods, he called on the international community including the United Nations to bridge resource and capacity gaps faced by the Government, as the 2021 Humanitarian Response Plan has a shortfall of nearly 33 per cent or 550 million. He noted improved communication between UNMISS and the Government, enhancing Mission operations, evident from the decrease in status of forces agreement violations. India has been one of the largest troop‑contributing countries to UNMISS since its establishment a decade ago, with nearly 2,300 troops serving in the country, and is also contributing to sustainable development and welfare of the people of South Sudan with computer training and veterinary assistance camps. SVEN JÜRGENSON Estonia said his country, for the entirety of its membership in the Security Council, has asked for the swifter implementation of the peace agreement in South Sudan, warning that this delay will eventually erode the credibility of that country’s leaders. Although Parliament was inaugurated on 30 August, it has made minimal progress, which in turn delays the passage of critical legislation. Parliament’s work is of crucial importance if South Sudan is to have free, fair and credible elections. The crackdown on civic space and the harassment of human rights activists are unacceptable. All civil society actors must be able to express their views freely and without fear of retaliation. Expressing concern about the extrajudicial executions carried out in Warrap and Lakes, he called on the Government to investigate these killings and stressed the need to improve the human rights situation, especially regarding conflict‑related sexual violence. JAMES KARIUKI United Kingdom said implementation of the peace agreement remains “too slow”, stressing this lack of progress has real and grave consequences for ordinary South Sudanese. Joining others in calling for South Sudan’s leaders to redouble their efforts in 2022, he said the recent progress on public financial management shows what can be achieved through partnership with the international community. He also urged the Government to approve the delayed annual budget, improve economic transparency and tackle corruption to improve livelihoods and help make that country more attractive to international investors. Refuting the argument that the arms embargo was responsible for the lengthy delays in graduating the Necessary Unified Forces, he recalled that an exemptions procedure remains in place to ensure the embargo does not constitute an obstacle to South Sudan’s legitimate security needs. He then reiterated the urgency of approving the proposed slate of Panel of Experts, so that this Council can be adequately briefed on the ongoing dynamics. SHERAZ GASRI France said the work of Parliament has not started while several key bills on several reforms need to be considered. The implementation of security arrangements also remained at a standstill. She expressed regret that the arms embargo is being used as a pretext to justify delays in forming unified forces. Noting the presentation by UNMISS of its assistance for the security reform process, she said France is mobilized to support these efforts, including the implementation of innovative strategies on the reintegration of ex‑combatants. Her country is also ready to strengthen the Mission’s technical assistance mandate, provided that the Government achieve the goals set by the Security Council. The South Sudanese authorities must redouble their efforts to ensure that general elections are held after the end of the transition period. In this regard, it is essential to put in place without delay the security arrangements, the constitutional and legislative framework for the elections, operationalize the national election commission and allocate the necessary resources to the organization of elections. All parties must ensure that unity prevails. Commending the efforts of regional actors to support the peace process, she encouraged the Intergovernmental Authority on Development IGAD , the African Union, Kenya and Uganda to remain mobilized in facilitating dialogue between the South Sudanese parties. ANNA M. EVSTIGNEEVA Russian Federation welcomed positive developments, including the continued functioning of the Revitalized Agreement, the preparation of a fundamental draft law on the Constitution, and the South Sudanese leadership’s evident intent to hold elections. However, the security situation remains complex, despite an overall decline in violence, and will play a decisive role in future outcomes. She expressed concern about ongoing clashes between Government forces and opposition groups, and about a split in the camp of the First Vice‑President Riek Machar, which was opposed by several influential field commanders. Moreover, reports of sporadic intercommunal conflict are concerning, particularly the situation in both Equatorias. She underlined the importance of swiftly establishing the unified armed forces, and to enhance dialogue with the Kitwang faction of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement Army in Opposition. Mutual trust can only be enhanced through the full implementation of the Revitalized Agreement. Further, she called for the sanctions regime against South Sudan to be reconsidered as the situation in the country normalizes, expressing her conviction that the control indicators pursuant to resolution 2577 2021 will be implemented. MONA JUUL Norway expressed deep concern about the situation in South Sudan, where the humanitarian situation has never been worse, and is now aggravated by heavy flooding. However, the main obstacle to a better future is the slow implementation of the Revitalized Agreement, she said, adding “A collapse of the peace agreement will have dire consequences for the whole region.” She welcomed the recent reconstitution, and appointment of members, to most of the State Assemblies, and urged the Government of South Sudan to finalize the process. While welcoming the President’s decision to resume the Rome talks with non‑signatories, she said South Sudan’s leaders must demonstrate real determination to make the whole agreement work. Moreover, the implementation of Chapter 2 on security arrangements must be finalized, and members must be urgently nominated to the Transitional National Legislate Assembly’s specialized committees to accelerate the passing of critical legislation. Delays will jeopardize the process towards free and fair elections. Norway is deeply concerned by the shrinking political space in South Sudan attempts to silence civil society activists and the media, through arbitrary arrests and unlawful detention runs counter to the spirit of the Peace Agreement, and the rule of law. She called for the full and meaningful participation of women to be ensured through a 35 per cent representation quota. Expressing concern about the many subnational conflicts, including in Tambura and Jonglei, she reiterated that the Government has a responsibility to protect all civilians. To curb corruption, it must also invest more in key reforms to bring transparency and accountability to the country’s public finances. HAI ANH PHAM Viet Nam , speaking in his national capacity, said in 2021 South Sudan continued to show progress in its peace process, as it marks its tenth anniversary of independence and third anniversary of the Revitalized Agreement. Despite remaining challenges, South Sudan is one of the African nations on the Council agenda with overall positive developments in the past two years. Calling on the Government and all relevant parties to continue advancing implementation of the Agreement, culminating in national elections, he urged advancement of constitutional reform and transitional security arrangements. He further called on the Government to facilitate participation of women in leadership to attain the 35 per cent goal. All relevant parties must continue to resolve their differences and engage in dialogue and confidence‑building, he said, emphasizing the roles played by UNMISS, the African Union, IGAD and other international partners in advancing peace and development. Stressing the critical importance of upholding the permanent ceasefire, he urged the Government to effectively and sustainably address intercommunal violence and ensure the safety of humanitarian workers. He commended efforts by the United Nations Mine Action Service in clearance and risk education activities. It is also crucial to tackle increasing economic and humanitarian challenges in the country, as 7.2 million people are affected by food insecurity — representing over half the population. Citing the importance of regular review of the sanctions regime, especially the implementation of key benchmarks in resolution 2577 2021 , he expressed hope that the Government will continue to cooperate, potentially creating the basis for the Council to review and consider lifting those measures. GENG SHUANG China hoped that the signatories of the Revitalized Agreement will expedite its implementation and bring about political stability. However, practical differences cannot be resolved in one fell swoop the international community should therefore support efforts to negotiate, instead of indulging in finger‑pointing. Welcoming the contributions of IGAD and the African Union to facilitate negotiations, he went on to express concern about persistent intercommunal clashes, and called on holdout groups to the Revitalized Agreement to renounce violence and join the political process without delay. Financial support must be lent to disarmament, demobilization, repatriation and reintegration programmes, and assistance must be ramped up to help South Sudan develop its economy. Highlighting the recently held Eighth Ministerial Conference of the China‑Africa Cooperation Forum, where nine projects were unveiled, covering areas ranging from health to poverty reduction, he went on to call for sanctions on Juba to be lifted without delay to spur development in South Sudan, and so the country can strengthen capacity‑building in the security sector. AGOK JOHN ANYAR MADUT AGOK South Sudan said that it is common knowledge that implementation of the Revitalized Agreement has been “slow, but steady”, emphasizing that all parties are committed to its full implementation in both letter and spirit. While widespread intra‑ and intercommunal conflict continues, such conflict has started to decline since the formation of state governments. Noting the President’s efforts towards peace, stability and reconciliation, he spotlighted — as a preventative measure — Mr. Kiir’s meeting with members of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement Army in Opposition to call for calm. Turning to climate change, he said that droughts and floods are causing displacement and suffering, and called on the international community to assist the Government not only with the immediate needs of affected populations, but also with long‑term adaptation and mitigation measures. For its part, South Sudan participates in all climate‑change fora, and he stressed that his country’s “commitment is driven by the impact we feel”. Underscoring that the financial weight of the Revitalized Agreement is too heavy for parties thereto to fund alone, he called on the Security Council and international community to “stop sitting on the fence, cherry‑picking”. “Let’s put our money where our mouths are”, he added.

"By Cydney Justman Hurricane Iota, thought to be the strongest storm ever to strike Nicaragua, slammed into the country’s Caribbean coast on Monday evening as a Category 4 hurricane. The storm made landfall in an almost identical location – and with similar force – to that of Hurricane Eta two weeks earlier. To date, Direct Relief has dispatched seven emergency shipments, with support from FedEx, to on the ground partners in Honduras and Nicaragua, totaling 62 pallets and with a value of almost 10 million. The pallets contained a large variety of medicines and supplies, including antibiotics, antifungals, cardiovascular medicines, vitamins, PPE, and wound care supplies. The death toll from Hurricane Eta is 185, with reported deaths in eight countries, including the United States. While the current death toll from Iota stands at 31, with 40 reported missing, those numbers are thought to be low due to compromised telecommunications limiting the dissemination of information, and are expected to increase in the coming days and weeks. Across Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador, over 200,000 people have been displaced, either temporarily or semi permanently. Before reaching the Nicaraguan mainland, Iota blew over the tiny Colombian island of Providencia population approximately 5,000 , where Colombian authorities report that one person was killed and 98 of the island’s infrastructure seriously affected. Providencia’s one hospital is reported to be largely inoperable. By early Wednesday, Iota had significantly weakened as it passed over mainland Central America, finally dissipating over El Salvador. However, while the winds decreased significantly about 20 hours after making landfall, the rainfall did not. The storm’s center passed south of Tegucigalpa, Honduras’s capital. There, it dropped extremely heavy rains where tens of thousands of people live in low lying, flood prone areas and in hillside neighborhoods prone to landslides. All in all, Iota drenched most of Nicaragua and Honduras and large parts of Guatemala it also caused flooding even in Panama and Costa Rica. “The whole Sula Valley is destroyed. Three satellite cities….are completely covered by water and thousands and thousands of people left homeless. Our already fragile economy is gone and it will take years to recover, if it ever happens,” wrote a Direct Relief partner based in Honduras. Governments have opened over 1,000 shelters for evacuees across the most affected areas. However, accessing basic commodities, such as food, clean drinking water, basic medicines, and masks for Covid 19 protection, has proven difficult. As roads and even major highways remain flooded, supply chains to shelters and isolated communities are heavily compromised. Direct Relief has received requests for support from Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and Colombia as governments, NGOs, and emergency medical teams work to respond to the needs of displaced communities. The organization is in the process of preparing two additional shipments, both containing emergency medical kits, to be sent to the Colombian island of Providencia and to Tegucigalpa, Honduras. In addition, Direct Relief is providing emergency operating grants to two long term partners in Honduras, Proyecto Aldea Global and Siempre Unidos, both of which are working tirelessly to meet medical needs in their communities. The organization will continue to monitor the impact from Hurricanes Eta and Iota and respond as needed.","['Epidemic', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Tropical Cyclone']"
" VANUA LAVA VOLCANO 13°80’S 167°47’E Summit 3021ft 921m Current Vanuatu Volcano Alert Level Level 1 Vanua Lava volcano is continuing in the level of low unrest. The Volcanic Alert Level remains at Level 1. The Vanua Lava volcanic activity is continuing at the low unrest level, consistent with the Volcanic Alert Level 1. New scientific analyses suggest that the volcanic activity is likely to continue at this same level of minor unrest. Volcanic hazards remain on the volcanic cone and sulfur river e.g. volcanic gases . Danger Zone for life safety is limited around the volcanic cone and the sulfur river. Latest observations and satellite data confirm that there is no significant manifestation and the volcanic activity conditions remain stable. There is an ongoing presence of volcanic gases around the volcanic cone and around the sulfur river. Gas smell will continue while approaching these two areas. The Volcanic Alert Level for Vanua Lava volcano has been at the Level 1 since 27th May 2016. The current observations are consistent with the activity of the Volcanic Alert Level 1. Level 1 indicates ‘Minor level of unrest Danger Zone is near the volcanic area and the sulfur river’ . Vanua Lava volcano is one of the active volcano in Vanuatu and in contrast to other large volcanoes in the country, it does not contain a youthful summit caldera. A chain of small stratovolcanoes, oriented along a NNE SSW line, gives the low angle volcano an irregular profile. Historically, this volcano had low infrequent activity except in XIX 19 century with 3 moderate manifestations and in XX 20 century with 2. All tourism agencies, visitors, local authorities, and people from Vanua Lava Island and general public are reminded that due to the current volcanic activity, the danger zone remains at around the sulfur river and volcano area. In these areas, volcanic gases will always be expected. Visitors may expect impact of this gas while approaching these two areas. The Vanuatu Meteorology and Geohazards Department will closely monitor this volcano activity. More information will be provided accordingly when necessary.

" A devastating 6.2 magnitude earthquake hit West Sulawesi, Indonesia, killing at least 73 people and injuring hundreds more. The earthquake's epicentre was 6km away from Majene City, and occurred at 1am on 15 January, when most people were in their homes sleeping. Hundreds of buildings have been damaged, and thousands had to flee their homes. 10,000 people are currently seeking refuge in temporary shelters. The full extent of the damage is yet to be determined and the number of casualties is expected to rise in the coming days . Reaching affected areas is a challenge as landslides have occurred as a result of the earthquake, roads are blocked and electricity and phone lines are also down.

" Juba, 14 October 2016 Alarming levels of malnutrition and a severe malaria outbreak are putting thousands of lives at risks in Northern Bahr el Ghazal, South Sudan. A full scale emergency response has been launched by the humanitarian community. Medair, an international emergency relief and recovery organisation, is part of this response and is providing emergency nutrition and health services, safe water, and sanitation and hygiene support. “Northern Bahr el Ghazal is experiencing one of the most severe malnutrition crises the country has seen in years,” says Becky Hammond, Medair’s Nutrition Advisor in South Sudan. In some areas, half of the population is facing severe food insecurity and one out of three people is already malnourished. The situation is particularly challenging due to the protracted crisis, which has led to a further increase in food prices. The closure of the border with Sudan, combined with late rains and flooding of field crops, has contributed to the worsening food insecurity. “The situation is bad. How am I going to sleep tonight? I didn’t even eat last night,” recounts Regina, a single mother of a 12 month old daughter living in the area. Regina cultivated her plot of land earlier this year, but the crops have been destroyed by flooding and she doesn’t have any other source of income. The only food available to Regina is pumpkin seeds and sometimes she is able to get hold of some dried fish. Regina’s daughter is severely malnourished. The emergency levels of malnutrition are compounded by a malaria upsurge in the past weeks and the limited access to water and sanitation facilities. The prevalence of malaria cases in the area has increased by 400 percent in nine weeks’ time. The limited availability of essential drugs and the small number of staff in health facilities have made it very difficult for people to receive adequate treatment in time unless they have enough money to pay. Medair’s emergency response team is providing critical services to the most vulnerable in the area. In the past weeks, the team has set up three emergency nutrition clinics to treat children under five with acute malnutrition and is aiming to establish four additional sites. The team is also providing emergency water, sanitation, and hygiene services and has opened a malaria treatment centre in Aweil town. Last week, the team saw 2,599 patients in the malaria treatment centre ̶ a reflection of the immense health needs in the area. Medair’s emergency response activities in Aweil are funded by the European Commission and the UK government. .","['Drought', 'Flood', 'Other']"
"Avijit Ghosh TNN May 27, 2017, 09.03 AM IST RAMGARH, WEST RAJASTHAN In the searing afternoon of early May, the expanse ahead is a simmering yellow and parched brown. Only a handful of the wondrous khejdi and ruida trees and a cluster of vilayati babool add a tinge of green. In this rather weather beaten side of Ramgarh, a kasbah about 65 kms from Jaisalmer, hundreds of sheep and goats crowd around livestock farmer Bhim Singh in a midday ritual that lasts almost half an hour. Bhim lowers an improvised plastic bucket tied to a rope into a beri a shallow sweet water community well draws out the life giving liquid and pours them into a small stone tub. In an adjacent beri, another livestock farmer does the same. As the animals gratefully quench their thirst, another couple of farmers with their flocks wait at a distance to avoid overlapping of the herds. These two beris are the only water source here during summer. Without them, the animals would have probably died, says Bhim. Born out of a traditional system of harvesting rainwater, beris are lifesavers for both humans and animals in parts of western Rajasthan for centuries. Shaped like matkas pitcher , these shallow wells are dug up in areas with gypsum or bentonite beds which prevent the rainwater from percolating downwards but guide them towards the wells through capillary action. Last year, Ramgarh and its surrounding villages hardly received any rain. But even then, these beris are fully charged. You can draw at least 10,000 litres of drinking water every day. It gets replenished overnight, says Chatar Singh, a 56 year old local eco warrior with a masterly knowledge of desert water conservation. His initiatives, in tandem with Sambhaav, an NGO aiding the restoration of aquifers, has led to the digging of dozens of new beris and the revival of others that had fallen fell into disuse. The long trek for drinking water is not so long anymore. The importance of beris is further underlined by what one notices a few kilometres away. Water from the humongous Indira Gandhi canal gathers in a pond like structure on its way to the filtering unit. Near the canal's Sagarmal Gopa branch, one also notices a cow's rotting carcass. The unclean water, full of green algae, looks unfit for consumption yet tractors line up to carry it away in huge cans. Hum yahi pani peete hain Everyone drinks this water , says class X student Suraj Singh Bhati, who's ferrying the water home for consumption. On the outskirts of Netsi village, 23 beris are in use. The village has a huge cement tank that stores water released from the IG canal. But many women trek a kilometer away to the village outskirts, where the beris are located. Most of us drink the beri's water, says Mala Devi. Undeniably, water from the IG canal has eased their woes but most villagers that TOI spoke also said that the taps are often run dry. We got water after a gap of five days, said Guddi of Ekalpar village. The traditional beris were made of wood. They would rot after a year. The new beris are built with long lasting blocks of yellow stones that Jaisalmer is known for, says retired armyman Jitu Singh. The success in these water harvesting projects has come by forging a partnership with locals. Netsi villagers provided free of charge labour required to make the beris functional again. Chatar spells out that the villagers were motivated to join the project while Sambhaav chipped in with materials. Nearly three decades ago, Chatar started teaching children of the bhil tribes in Ekalpar and Dobalpar, once regarded among the two poorest village in the area. But over the last 10 years, he was worked primarily in the field of water conservation in association with Farhad Contractor of Sambhaav, who routinely visits these villages. Part of their vast work is helping the bhil tribe learn the traditional art of khadeen, a form of cultivation in arid, scanty rainfall region where the land's moistness is harnessed to produce wheat, mustard and black gram, among other things. We help them help themselves, says Farhad.","['Drought', 'Heat Wave']"
"The Asia Pacific region is one of the most disaster prone areas in the world, experiencing nearly half of the world’s natural disasters in the past decade. Around 200 million children living in this region, are at risk of losing their lives, their livelihood or face displacement from their homes because of natural disasters. These disasters not only jeopardise a child’s right to survival but affects their basic education. TYPHOON HAIYAN In November 2013, Typhoon Haiyan https blogs.savethechildren.org.uk 2013 11 the philippines typhoon haiyan , one of the most powerful typhoons on record, struck the Philippines. Darin, who was 18 years old at the time, was on a bus to her hometown in Iloilo province when she saw the destruction the typhoon had caused. “I could not help myself from crying as I saw the aftermath of the disaster,” she said. “Many houses and infrastructure were damaged, trees were uprooted, roads were damaged, and communities were terribly affected.” Darin thought that if people were more prepared, the impact may not have been as big as it was. WORKING WITH PRUDENCE FOUNDATION TO KEEP SCHOOLS SAFE Since 2013, Save the Children have been working in partnership with Prudence Foundation https www.savethechildren.org.uk about us who we work with corporate partners prudence foundation? ga 2.48464290.508351678.1565957951 69005545.1565957951 to ensure children in the Philippines are safe from disasters through their joint Safe Schools project. Like Darin, the partnership recognises the importance of education and preparedness in helping to reduce the risks caused by natural disasters and supporting an early recovery. The project provides direct training to children and teachers on how to better prepare for, manage and quickly recover from the impacts of disasters. Known as Batang Child in Filipino Empowered and Resilient Team BERT facilitators, lead school children are trained to promote disaster preparedness and children’s rights among their fellow students. Equally teachers themselves are trained as Advisors to ensure they have the capacity to support and coach BERT children. HELPING CHILDREN TO BE BETTER PREPARED FOR DISASTERS Darin, now a BERT Advisor in her school, can see the changes the project has brought to her students. “Students did not know how to protect themselves from disasters or natural hazards,” she said. However, after embedding disaster risk reduction related activities into her lessons she noticed that students became more aware of the different early warning systems and what do in times of emergencies. The impact of BERT has been so successful in increasing children’s awareness and preparedness for disasters, that the Filipino Department of Education issued a memorandum to institutionalise BERT in every public school in the Division of Iloilo. Subsequently, the project has grown from supporting an initial 10 partner schools, to training over 3,000 children as BERT facilitators across 313 schools in the Philippines. WHAT’S NEXT FOR SAFE SCHOOLS IN THE PHILIPPINES? With Prudence Foundation’s https www.prudentialcorporation asia.com corp prudential pca en our foundation continued support, we are now working with national and local governments to address the challenges and barriers that prevent the scale up of a safe schools initiative across the Philippines, providing the opportunity to ensure all children and their families are safe from disasters.","['Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Storm Surge', 'Tropical Cyclone']"
" Key messages • A deadly mix of conflict, COVID 19 and the climate crisis have pushed more than 7 million people across six countries in East Africa to the very edge of starvation. According to UN reports, approximately 108,000 people in East Africa are under catastrophic famine conditions, a phase marked by critical acute malnutrition, starvation, destitution and death – this phase is understood in the humanitarian sector as the highest and most urgent Integrated Food Insecurity Phase Classification IPC of level 5. Additionally, almost 7.8 million people are exposed to emergency phase IPC4 , and if things worsen are one step away from famine, and as many as 26 million are classified at ‘crisis level’ IPC3 , where action is needed now to stop them sliding into emergency. • The region has endured substantial and widespread breeding of desert locusts since late 2019, resulting in loss of pasture and crops. Added to this, between June – December 2020 rising conflict in countries such as Ethiopia has exacerbated the food insecurity situation in the region. The Climate Prediction and Application Centre and the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation have both made predictions of dry conditions and worsening food insecurity situation in 2021. Coupled with economic impact of COVID 19 lockdowns continue to destroy livelihoods and push millions into desperation. • This challenging period could erode human and economic development gains that have been made towards the global Sustainable Development Goals across the region. The rising food insecurity also increases the risks faced by women and girls, including gender based violence and sexual exploitation and abuse.","['Drought', 'Epidemic', 'Insect Infestation', 'Other']"

" As prepared for delivery Good morning Good afternoon Thank you for joining us today. Before I introduce our amazing panel of young leaders, let me briefly speak to the findings of the new UNICEF climate report we are launching today “ The Coldest Year Of The Rest Of Their Lives. Protecting Children From The Escalating Impacts Of Heatwaves .” https reliefweb.int node 3899847 This year – all over the world – we have seen evidence of the increasing dangers presented by climate change. From historic flooding in Asia, to deadly droughts in Africa, plus the wildfires and heatwaves that swept through India, Europe, and North America, it is clear the climate crisis is here and it is having devastating impacts on the well being of children and young people globally. Our children can no longer count on the environmental and social conditions previous generations have been used to. They are being forced to grow in a world that is becoming far more dangerous and uncertain. In August 2021, UNICEF launched The Children’s Climate Risk Index https www.unicef.org reports climate crisis child rights crisis , the world’s first child focused climate index. It found that 1 billion children globally – almost half of the world’s children – are at ‘extremely high risk’ of suffering from climate shocks such as heatwaves, cyclones, flooding and water scarcity. The UNICEF climate index sounded the alarm on the climate dangers children face and made it crystal clear that the climate crisis is a child rights crisis. This year, we took a closer look at heatwaves and the unique way children are affected by them. Children are more vulnerable to the impacts of extreme heat and heatwave events than adults. Infants and young children are less able to regulate their body temperature compared to adults, putting them more at risk when exposed to high heat. And beyond the threat that heatwaves pose to children’s health, they also threaten their access to food and water, their education, and their future livelihoods. This past year, many of us experienced extreme heatwaves in the cities where we live. And as we moved indoors, as we drank more fluids, as we even closed schools in some places and took many other steps to keep ourselves and our young people safe, a frightening conclusion became apparent to us all If you think this summer was hot, wait until next year, and the year after that, and the year after that. Indeed, for our children, for the young people you will hear from today, this was likely the coldest year of the rest of their lives. As we examined the data for this new climate report, we were struck by just how fast heatwaves are escalating. Our projections for 2050 make it clear, the full force of heatwaves is right around the corner. We discovered that children on every continent are experiencing now the devastating impacts of heatwaves and that, by every measure, more children will be exposed to heatwaves by 2050 compared to 2020, threatening their wellbeing and in some cases, their very survival. With thanks to our partners at The Data Collaborative for Children, who spearheaded this analysis, let me share four key topline findings and figures. 559 million children – or 1 in 4 – are currently exposed to high heatwave frequency. By 2050, virtually every child on earth – just over 2 billion children – is forecast to face frequent heatwaves, regardless of whether the world achieves a ‘low greenhouse gas emission scenario’ with an estimated 1.7 degrees of warming in 2050 or a ‘very high greenhouse gas emission scenario’ with an estimated 2.4 degrees of warming in 2050. 528 million children are impacted now by high heatwave duration . This will rise to 1.6 billion children in 2050 under a ‘low greenhouse gas emission scenario’ or 1.9 billion children under a ‘very high greenhouse gas emission scenario’. 28 million children are exposed now to high heatwave severity. Under a ‘low greenhouse gas emissions’ scenario the number of exposed will almost quadruple to 100 million . It is an almost eight fold increase to 212 million children under a ‘very high emissions scenario’. 740 million children live now in countries experiencing extreme high heat of 84 or more days per year exceeding 35 degrees Celsius. This will rise to about 816 million by 2050 under a ‘very high greenhouse gas emission scenario’. Again, we see how the devastating results of climate change are not discriminating across borders. Heatwaves are escalating in every corner of the world. There is an inherit injustice to this. Some of the countries least responsible for the climate crisis are the ones warming fastest, and facing the most frequent and damaging impacts. Children from the poorest communities face the greatest risks from heatwaves, and yet often receive the least support. They are more likely to lack access to coping mechanisms that could offer protection such as air conditioning, shelter, water for hydration and healthcare for treatment. We need to equip communities with the resources they need to withstand the heatwaves they are inevitably going to face. So again, we sound the alarm. In collaboration with and on behalf of children and young people everywhere, UNICEF is making 10 key asks of world leaders now, and at COP27 in Egypt next month. One UNICEF urges leaders and governments to take immediate action to protect children from climate devastation by adapting the critical social services they rely on, such as water, health, nutrition and education. All social services must be climate sensitive and all climate policies and plans must be child sensitive. Two We urge countries to implement comprehensive climate adaptation plans – this is one of the most effective ways of protecting children and young people from the impacts of the climate crisis now and is critical for the resilience of every country. Three Further, developed countries must deliver on their COP26 commitments to double adaptation funding to 40bn per year by 2025 at a minimum, as a step to delivering at least 300bn per year for adaptation by 2030. Four Climate adaptation funding must make up half of all climate finance. And all climate adaptation funding must be child sensitive. Five As a global community, we must do this while continuing to reduce emissions and transitioning to renewable energy production. Six All governments must revisit their national climate plans and cut emissions by at least 45 per cent by 2030 to keep heating to no more than 1.5°C. G20 countries should take the lead. Seven To help children prepare for the future, governments must provide them with climate change education, green skills training and opportunities to meaningfully participate and influence climate policy making. Eight At COP27, we must see children and their rights prioritized in decisions on adaptation. Nine We want to see delegations strengthen the focus on children’s climate education and empowerment in the ACE action plan, adopt it, and implement previous commitments to build youth capacity. Ten We want to see progress on loss and damage, with the survival of vulnerable children and their communities at the center of discussions. Young people on the frontlines of this crisis, like Fatima Faraz who is with us today from Pakistan, deserve more attention from world leaders and a more meaningful seat at the table in the decisions that will define their future. That’s why UNICEF works all around the world with young people and youth movements like Vanessa Nakate and the Rise Up Movement, Sophia Kianni and the Climate Cardinals and Luisa Neubauer and Fridays for Future. And it’s why – for COP27 – we are going to do everything we can to ensure young people have a meaningful role. We are calling on all parties to include children and young people within their delegations so that they can access the negotiations that will decide their futures and we are using UNICEF’s platform to give them the floor, and the microphone. This is a decisive moment for the future of our planet and for our young people. Now, it is time for you to hear from them. It is my pleasure to hand over to UNICEF’s newest Goodwill Ambassador, Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate.

"Heavy and erratic rains over the past weeks have sparked the third flash floods in nine months in the southern states of Somalia, displacing almost 150,000 children with their families over the past months, and inundating over 33,000 hectares of farmland. Save the Children warned this could have a devastating impact on the lives of thousands of children. Over 40 villages bein South West State, home to thousands of children, have been flooded since late June. According to the UN, in the Shabelle region alone some 15,000 people were displaced on 14 and 15 July when floods hit the area. Flash flooding is uncommon during the dry season in Somalia. The floods, recent swarms of locusts and the loss of livelihoods have pushed tens of thousands of people into food insecurity, as food prices have soared and food production has plummeted by 30 40 percent in parts of the country. “We are extremely concerned about the situation in Hirshabele and the Southwest states, where families and children are facing hunger which will cause malnutrition rates to skyrocket. The recurring and erratic floods that are hampering these regions have caused crops to fail, severely endangering the production of enough nutritious food for the children”, said Mohamud Mohamed Hassan, Country Director of Save the Children in Somalia “The floods and the still waters are a perfect breeding ground for mosquitos, which brings concerns of a possible malaria outbreak. With the existing crisis in Somalia including food insecurity, malnourishment of children, conflict and locust swarms, the floods are putting the lives of children at even higher risk”, warns Mr. Hassan. “More resources are needed to tackle this crisis.” Save the Children is expanding its existing programmes to support the new arrivals in Mogadishu, as at least another 1,000 households who left their areas because of the floods are expected to arrive in already overcrowded camps for internally displaced people.","['Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Insect Infestation']"

" CRISIS OVERVIEW On 9 April 2021, after months of heightened activity, La Soufrière volcano entered an explosive state on Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. To date, it is estimated that 20,000 persons have been displaced through mandatory evacuation of the red and orange zones, which commenced on April 8. However, the vast majority of the population has been adversely impacted by this disaster. The eruption of La Soufrière comes as Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is recovering from its largest COVID 19 surge amid the pandemic, and the region’s worst Dengue outbreak in recent history. La Soufrière is likely continue to erupt in the coming weeks and maybe even months. The long term effects of a protracted eruption on agriculture and tourism, which are the mainstays of the Vincentian economy and contribute about half of the Gross Domestic Product GDP , will further exacerbate the already devastating socioeconomic impact of COVID 19. It will also reduce capacity for recovery and erode hard earned development gains. A rapid response that effectively links immediate humanitarian assistance to early recovery and rehabilitation is urgently needed, as the fast approaching hurricane season poses an additional threat to an already vulnerable population. Most affected areas The parishes in the evacuated orange and red zones have been most affected by the current volcanic eruption and its heavy ash fall and pyroclastic flows, especially towns closest to La Soufrière. According to preliminary reports, extensive damage has occured in the island’s northern region, with forests and farms completely wiped out and staple crops, including plantain and bananas, destroyed. As such, early recovery of livelihoods and rehabilitation of critical services and infrastructure are of paramount importance to address both immediate humanitarian needs and longer term reconstruction and development. The continued eruption of La Soufrière is not only affecting Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, but also Barbados, where thick ash plumes travelling east, have engulfed the country, forcing the temporary closure of many businesses ,already hard hit by COVID 19, and delayed the reopening of schools. The Government of Barbados has expressed concern about the potential impact of intense ash fall on public health, infrastructure, agriculture and tourism,and has sought UN assistance on ash and debris cleanup, and for environmental health and technical experts to join national loss, damage and needs assessment efforts. Furthermore, other countries of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States OECS have offered to host evacuees who prefer to leave the country to live with family and friends in neighboring states.","['Epidemic', 'Volcano']"

"As the conflict in Ukraine continues, the shock waves are being felt all the way in Southern Africa which is still reeling from one of the worst cyclone seasons. From a shortage of relief supplies to hiked fuel costs, communities that were slowly recovering from the loss of livelihoods and floods now face another challenge as the cost of living increases. This has impacted response efforts and raises the worry of how the people will recover and resume normal living as things become more expensive. Hiked wheat and fuel costs are not only causing an increase in the cost of living but also putting the jobs of hundreds, in several sectors, at risk. In Zambia and Zimbabwe, where the economies were already fragile, fuel prices have increased by 13 percent and 7 percent respectively in Countries. On March 11th, Cyclone Gombe, a Category 3 storm struck Nampula province in Mozambique. So far, 61 fatalities have been recorded with over 450,000 people displaced. As humanitarian efforts are ramping up, the challenge of available supplies is hitting hard. Christine Beasley, CARE Mozambique Country Director said, Commonly used relief supplies including tarps and tents are difficult to find. Many pre positioned relief supplies from donors are being channeled to Ukraine and Poland to meet the massive needs of refugees, and available supplies are running low for emergencies elsewhere, including in Mozambique. For an emergency response to be credible, it has to be fast. With the current shortages of pre positioned supplies, our only option may be to order directly from the factories in China and this will certainly not be fast enough to meet the immediate needs of people displaced by Cyclone Gombe . Mozambique has also seen a rise in fuel prices, the most recent by 12 percent, that the Mozambican government has attributed to the conflict in Ukraine. In Malawi, where 70 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, jobs are at risk as a result of the conflict. Amos Zaindi, CARE Malawi Country Director said, Slightly over 20 percent of the Country's wheat dependency is on imports from Russia. Due to interruptions in the supply chain, this has led to a 40 percent increase in the production cost of bread and wheat products. Dailies have reported that since the conflict started, there has been an increase of 50 percent in cooking oil prices. These costs have been passed on to consumers. Those who work in the sectors that depend on these imports are wary of their jobs. These hikes and potential job losses are of particular concern to CARE as it risks more people sliding into poverty. Displacement due to extreme weather events and a worsening fragile humanitarian situation needs attention and support to ensure at risk communities are supported as they recover. Chikondi Chabvata, CARE International Southern Africa Advocacy Advisor said, In a situation where vulnerabilities are already high due to the adverse impacts of climate change, having conflicts that impact the global food supply chains leaves those who are at risk worse off than they were. We have already seen an increase in the prices of fuel, wheat, cooking oil, and rice. In a region highly susceptible to the effects of climate change, conflicts such as the one in Ukraine take attention away from these climate induced disasters. This means worse off conditions, and no one gets to see it and appreciate the human suffering that conflicts create even outside their boundaries of war.

"Pretoria – As the Western Cape faces a serious drought due to poor rainfall during winter, the Department of Water and Sanitation has informed the agricultural sector of 10 percent additional water restrictions. The demand for water in the province has steadily increased due to the growing population and economy. This, as well as poor rainfall, has added significant pressure on water supply. “To further curb excessive water use, the Department of Water and Sanitation has informed the agricultural sector of 10 additional water restrictions. The water restrictions will remain until the dams fill up to 85 of their capacity, Minister in the Presidency for Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation DPME Jeff Radebe said on Wednesday. He was briefing media in Cape Town on the outcomes of the Cabinet meeting on 1 March 2017. “In order to assist with the difficulties with regard to water availability in the Western Cape, attempts need to be instituted to provide greater comfort in the form of additional alternate water supply sources that must be on standby should inadequate water be received for this season,” he said. Minister Radebe said the country meanwhile welcomes the much needed rains elsewhere which will go a long way in relieving the country from the effects of drought. Dams and rivers are showing signs of increasing volumes. However, the possibility of flash flooding remains high. “We call on communities to remain vigilant of flash flooding which could lead to the loss of life, destruction to property and infrastructure. Government and its agencies are actively monitoring the situation and are ready to act where necessary.” The Minister said at its meeting on Wednesday, Cabinet welcomed the progress made in the distribution of animal feeds to support farmers in the country’s drought affected areas. The initiative is part of the R212 million in support, which government has made available in 2016 17 to assist affected farmers across the country. Provinces have also made R198 million available through equitable share funding, and funds from the Prevention and Mitigation of Disaster Risk programme were used to drill boreholes and construct fire breaks. Fall Army Worm Minister Radebe said following the positive identification of the Fall Army Worm infestation, government led by the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, is continuing with the assessment of spread and damage. Government is also continuing with awareness actions to provide farmers with accurate technical information and control options as well as to ensure the responsible emergency registration of agricultural chemicals.

" This is a summary of what was said by Marixie Mercado, UNICEF spokesperson in Geneva – to whom quoted text may be attributed – at today's press briefing at the Palais des Nations in Geneva. GENEVA BEIRUT, 21 AUGUST 2020 – “We have an update on the ongoing assessments and response work in Beirut. First, on psychosocial support, which is a major programmatic priority In a rapid needs assessment conducted by UNICEF and partners, which took place between 10 and 17 August, half of respondents reported that children in their households were showing changes in behavior or signs of trauma or extreme stress following the explosions. These behaviours and symptoms can include severe anxiety quietness or withdrawing from parents and families nightmares and trouble sleeping and aggressive behavior. One third of households also reported negative symptoms among adults. It is clear the needs are immense. Many children will require urgent and sustained psychosocial support to address the trauma of the explosions. UNICEF’s psychosocial support comes in the form of psychosocial kits for children and parents setting up child friendly spaces in affected areas and the provision of more specialized, intensive, and longer term support for those who need it. A little more on the wider impact of the blasts. According to the latest information An estimated 5 per cent of buildings in affected areas have been disconnected from the main water network. Households still have no clean water supply due to damage to the connections between water sources and buildings and within buildings Waste management services are limited and delayed, increasing the risk of water borne diseases Six major hospitals and 20 clinics sustained partial or heavy structural damage, reducing collective health capacity by 500 hospital beds The Ministry of Education and Higher Education reports 159 public and private schools and 20 Technical and Vocational schools serving 50,000 children and young people have sustained minor to significant damage. And some of what we have been able to do so far, with partners Reach hundreds of children with psycho social first aid, and hundreds of caregivers with health counseling and referrals Re connected over 60 buildings to the public water system and installed 109 water tanks in damaged households Relocated 98 per cent of the medications and vaccines from the Central Drug Warehouse and distributed them to Primary Health Care Centers, dispensaries, UNHCR vaccination sites, and other immunization points Repaired two vaccine cold rooms and two solar fridges, and installed a generator at the main public hospital. Brought in three shipments of humanitarian supplies including 3.5 milllion in PPE supplies. And, supported over 1,100 young people to clean and do minor repairs of damaged homes, and to distribute food and masks. UNICEF requires US 46.7 million to respond to the immediate needs of children and families over the next three months. The response focuses on keeping children safe rehabilitating basic essential services and equipping adolescents and young people with skills they need to be part of the effort to rebuild their country – all while limiting the spread of COVID 19. We have received US 1.3 million, with more in the pipeline. We are grateful for these timely and flexible contributions and further support is vital.

" Highlights • Local community transmission of COVID 19 continues in Tonga with 287 confirmed cases and one death. • The State of Emergency for the volcanic eruption and the State of Public Health Emergency because of COVID 19 have been extended until 14 March 2022. • Lockdown restrictions have been eased for a few days which provides a brief window for partners to distribute emergency relief supplies to communities and schools in Tongatapu. • The Government of Tonga is transitioning into recovery phase with plans being developed by national clusters. Situation Overview Humanitarian Needs Localized community transmission of COVID 19 in Tonga continues as the emergency response in the wake of the volcanic eruption and ensuing tsunami transitions into recovery mode. As of 23 February 2022, 287 COVID 19 cases have been confirmed with one death. More than 91 of Tonga’s eligible population of 12 years old and over are fully vaccinated against COVID 19. The lockdown that had been imposed at the start of the outbreak has been eased in Tongatapu and Vava’u island districts, where there are active cases, while it has been lifted in Ha’apai and ‘Eua group of islands, where no cases have been recorded. The lockdown slowed down the distribution of some relief supplies as all inter island shipping was suspended and focus was given to families in isolation. The State of Emergency for the volcanic eruption and the State of Public Health Emergency for the COVID 19 pandemic have been extended until 14 March 2022. International communication with Tonga has been restored with the repair of the submarine fiber optic cable damaged by the tsunami. The World Bank’s Global Rapid Post Disaster Damage Estimation GRADE report places the damage of this event at USD 90.4 million or equivalent to 18.5 of the country’s Gross Domestic Product GDP , with Tongatapu accounting for 76 of the damage, with tourism and agriculture being the most affected sectors.","['Epidemic', 'Flood', 'Tsunami', 'Volcano']"
" Overview A magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck Haiti on the 14th of August, 2021, causing damage, devastation, and destruction in the southwestern parts of the country. The epicentre was located about 125km west of the capital city of Port au Prince at a depth of about 10 kilometres USGS . The Haitian Civil Protection General Directorate DGPC has stated that 137,000 families have been affected in the South, Grande'Anse, and Nippes departments. About 500,000 people – 40 of the total population in the affected departments – need emergency humanitarian assistance. According to the OCHA, the death toll has soared to nearly 2,200, with more than 12,000 injured and 344 people missing. More than 80 percent of these deaths are registered in the South department. These figures are likely to rise as the after effects of the earthquake, along with the effects of Storm Grace, are fully realised. Storm Grace added 10 inches of rain to the already devastated southwestern departments. In addition, more than 52,900 homes were destroyed and 77,000 damaged. • Preliminary assessment has shown devastating damages to houses, roads, and bridges disrupting aid movement into the affected areas. • This report summarizes satellite analysis focused on one of the most affected areas in Haiti, specifically the South, Grande’ Anse, and Nippes departments in the south west of the country.",['Earthquake']
"Lebanon is reeling from yet another crisis that is set to further destabilise the already struggling nation, after a fuel tanker exploded in Akkar in the north of the country. It has left around 30 reported dead and more than 100 injured. Akkar where the explosion happened is the poorest area in Lebanon, with a high proportion of Syrian refugees. CARE Lebanon Area Manager Juliana Bssawmai visited the al Salam hospital in Akkar today to assess the needs as CARE plans to provide a response “The situation here is terrible, there remain unidentified bodies, and the fuel crisis across the country means even the biggest hospitals are struggling to run life saving machinery and lack even basic first aid equipment, let alone the smaller health facilities outside the main cities. Here the doctors are not sure how much longer they will be able to operate for. When the injured began arriving early this morning, those who brought people to the hospital were just throwing water on them because they couldn’t find any medicines to treat the burns.” Mouein Chreiteh lost both his sons 16 year old Jalal and 20 year old Khaled to the fuel tanker tragedy. He says “my sons died for 50,000 pounds 2.5 USD ” the price of 20 litres of gasoline that the two young men planned to take home . Here we lack everything, water, electricity, fuel, generators. We have always been left behind and because we are left behind, we are used like cannon fodder. We are begging for bread, milk, food. Even for DNA tests allowing me to identify my children's bodies, it takes twice as long as elsewhere in the country. Lebanon is on the brink, I know. But I have nothing more to lose I have just lost two children. CARE is planning to respond to this latest crisis with psychosocial support to those who have lost loved ones, as well as basic supplies to families affected amongst other interventions. Gul Rehman, CARE Lebanon Deputy Country Director says, “Lebanon and its people are taking blow after blow, and we do not know how much more it can stand. This latest tragedy comes on top of a worsening economic crisis, pushing over half the population into poverty and causing shortages of everything from fuel to medicines and food. The country’s capital Beirut is also still recovering from the devastating blast that happened last year in August, with huge rehabilitation efforts still needed. Now we see one of the country’s poorest and most vulnerable communities affected by a new tragedy. It is heart breaking.” ENDS.",['Technological Disaster']
"Prime Minister Taur Matan Ruak led today, June 22, 2020, a meeting of the interministerial commission set up to respond to the impacts of natural disasters in Timor Leste in recent months. The main objectives of the meeting were to discuss the interventions already undertaken and to ensure the coordination of planned and already ongoing measures, in the response to the damage caused by natural disasters and their impact on the population. At the meeting, the Minister of State Administration, Miguel Pereira de Carvalho, as coordinator of the interministerial commission, gave an update on the support already given to victims of natural disasters. Next, the Secretary of State for Protection, Alexandrino de Araújo, presented in detail the data referring to the support already given to the affected population. In October 2019, 2,979 families were affected by the fires and strong winds that ravaged the municipalities of Ainaro, Aileu, Bobonoro, Ermera and Liquiça. The affected population received a total support of US 933,806 in food, non food equipment and construction materials. The Secretary of State also presented the data on the response to the floods of January and February in the Municipality of Dili and the support provided for the recovery of the fire occurred, on March 1 at the College of Maliana. Regarding the March 13 floods, which affected 4,681 families in the city of Dili, the Secretariat of State provided food, non food and building materials worth 1,516,850. A total of 2,194 families from the municipalities of Baucau, Covalima, Lautém, Manatuto, Manufahi and Viqueque received emergency support of US 450,000 to cope with the impacts of floods, landslides and strong winds that ravaged the eastern tip and southern coast of the country. The Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Social Solidarity and Inclusion, Armanda Berta dos Santos, also detailed the support given to the population by the Ministry in coordination with other Ministries and organizations for the response to victims of natural disasters.

"Disaster preparedness is an important part of ACT Alliance members’ response in the Philippines after supertyphoon Haiyan. It is only a matter of time when the next powerful typhoon or some other natural catastrophe hits this extremely disaster prone country. However, next time does not have to be deadly, as a lot can be done to mitigate the impact of a disaster. That is the message of ACT Alliance members when they conduct Disaster Risk Reduction Trainings in the communities they are working with. “If the community is prepared, it can cope with the impact of a disaster”, says Education Officer Edward Santos from ACT member the National Council of Churches in the Philippines NCCP . The training participants in Odoc, a fisher village badly damaged by Haiyan, listen attentively. They are poor farmers, fishers, housewives, youngsters and elderly. They have all been battered by storms. “I decided to attend Community Based Disaster Risk Reduction training, because I want to know how to protect my family during a storm”, says Erlinda Torbeles, 48. Philippines has usually 20 typhoons every year, with five of them destructive. The effects of climate change come in the form of more intense and erratic storms, sea level rise and increasing heat. In addition, the Philippines is situated in the Pacific Ring of Fire, where a large number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur. About a third of the population lives below the poverty line. The poor are hit hardest by calamities, as they have very limited means to protect themselves. But something can always be done. In fact, the knowledge of what to do is there already – not with the experts or humanitarian workers, but with the local people. Their quiet knowledge of their own area is taken up and discussed together in the trainings. The participants identify and assess the risks, vulnerabilities and capacities of their own village. Together they brainstorm the preferred activities what the village can do to reduce risks, what NCCP can do to assist, and what remains the responsibility of the local government. The objective of the trainings is that communities can develop comprehensive preparedness plans counter disaster plan . Another goal is to create a change of mindset toward self relience and responsible ownership of the survival of the community. Disaster Risk Reduction training means increasing people’s capacity to cope or withstand impacts of disasters and address the causes of people’s vulnerability. “I really learned a lot. As we have no evacuation center in the village, we need to think in advance where to find shelter during a powerful storm. It’s very important that the community works together in this. We need to think, how to riprap the river which always floods after strong rains. Some unsafe bridges also need to be replaced”, Torbeles says. After compiling the disaster preparedness plan, the next step in Odoc will be to make a proposition to NCCP for assistance for the riprapping work. As the bridge repair and building a storm wall at the sea front are the responsibility of the municipal government, NCCP can help the community with advocacy efforts towards the municipal government. Beside the Disaster Risk Reduction Trainings, ACT members continue shelter and livelihood support in the typhoon Haiyan affected areas during the Haiyan Follow on Appeal period 2015 2016.","['Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Storm Surge', 'Tropical Cyclone']"
"Islamic Relief is helping families in desperate need following a terrifying tsunami in Indonesia. We are supporting survivors of the disaster, which struck popular tourist spots on the Sunda Strait overnight on Saturday. Believed to have been caused by underwater landslides following volcanic eruptions, the giant waves hit at around 9.20pm. There was no warning. More than 200 people are known to have died, and more than 840 were injured. With many more people still missing, the number of casualties is expected to rise further in the coming days and hours. Eyewitnesses reported cars being tossed around like toys. Families IR has been helping, have told our staff how they ran for the hills as they saw the massive wave approaching. People have said that they ran from their homes in the pouring rain in terror. Some have already started going back but others are too afraid of what they will find and worry that loved ones or neighbours may not have been able to escape the destruction. Responding to an unfolding emergency Across three regions – Pandegland, South Lampung and Serang beaches – hundreds of homes and buildings are thought to have been destroyed or damaged. The Indonesian disaster management agency has reported damage to hotels, food stalls and 350 boats – all important to local livelihoods. The full scale of the disaster continues to emerge, but right now the most urgent needs are for food, shelter, medical assistance and essential items like hygiene kits. Survivors are being helped by emergency teams from Islamic Relief Indonesia and our local partner PKPU. The latest devastating disaster in Indonesia The tsunami is thought to have been triggered by an underwater collapse as the nearby Anak Karaktau volcano erupted. The volcano has been erupting throughout the year. It is the latest in a series of disasters to hit Indonesia. About three months ago, an earthquake triggered a tsunami and landslides which killed more than 2,000 people. As well as providing humanitarian supplies in the aftermath of the September disaster, Islamic Relief has been helping local families to earn a living once more – and we are committed to building shelters and a school. Islamic Relief Indonesia last month issued a heartfelt appeal for continued support for disaster affected families. Islamic Relief, which has provided critical humanitarian support in Indonesia since 2000, remains on alert for further disasters.",['Tsunami']
" VANUA LAVA VOLCANO 13°80’S 167°47’E Summit 3021ft 921m Current Vanuatu Volcano Alert Level Level 1 Vanua Lava volcano is continuing in the level of low unrest. The Volcanic Alert Level remains at Level 1. The Vanua Lava volcanic activity is continuing at the low unrest level, consistent with the Volcanic Alert Level 1. New scientific analysis suggest that the volcanic activity is likely to continue at this same level of minor unrest. Volcanic hazards remain on the volcanic cone and sulfur river e.g. volcanic gases . Danger Zone for life safety is limited around the volcanic cone and the sulfur river. Latest observations and satellite data confirm that there is no significant manifestation and the volcanic activity conditions remain stable. There is an ongoing presence of volcanic gases around the volcanic cone and around the sulfur river. Gas smell will continue while approaching these two areas. The Volcanic Alert Level for Vanua Lava volcano has been at the Level 1 since 27th May 2016. The current observations are consistent with the activity of the Volcanic Alert Level 1. Level 1 indicates ‘Minor level of unrest Danger Zone is near the volcanic area and the sulfur river’. Vanua Lava volcano is one of the active volcano in Vanuatu and in contrast to other large volcanoes in the country, it does not contain a youthful summit caldera. A chain of small stratovolcanoes, oriented along a NNE SSW line, gives the low angle volcano an irregular profile. Historically, this volcano had low infrequent activity except in XIX 19 century with 3 moderate manifestations and in XX 20 century with 2. All tourism agencies, visitors, local authorities, and people on Vanua Lava Island and general public are reminded that due to the current volcanic activity, the danger zone remains at around the sulfur river and volcano area. In these areas, volcanic gases will always be expected. Visitors may expect impact of this gas while approaching these two areas. The Vanuatu Meteorology and Geohazards Department will closely monitor this volcano activity. More information will be provided accordingly when necessary.

"By Sofía García García, Representative to the UN and Head of Strategic Partnerships and Elisabeth Schmidt Hieber, Communications Advisor Advocacy at SOS Children’s Villages International One year on from the adoption of the UN Resolution on the Rights of the Child focusing, for the first time ever, on children without parental care, awareness and recognition of the situation of this group of children have increased. It is now time to act and make those commitments a reality putting policies and finance in place to realize them for all children. We need to come together in a multi stakeholder partnership to make this work. The UN General Assembly resolution A RES 74 133 https undocs.org en A RES 74 133 was adopted on 12 November 2019. It is a landmark step in recognizing the situation of children without parental care. Never before had member states made such an explicit commitment to end unnecessary child family separation and address its root causes effectively. Proper implementation at national and regional levels, however, is yet to follow. In fact, since the adoption of the resolution, a lot has changed. More children are in a vulnerable situation, more families struggle economically and there is a risk of regressing on child protection measures. The COVID 19 pandemic and related measures have further exposed already existing inequalities in accessing basic rights such as education. Worse, the pandemic has been used at times to justify a neglect of monitoring and implementing children’s well being and rights, ignoring the negative long term consequences of doing so. According to findings of UNICEF https data.unicef.org topic child poverty covid 19 , 117 million more children could be pushed into monetary poor households by the end of this year alone. Poverty is a major root cause of preventable child family separation. These most recent developments demonstrate how needed the resolution’s commitments are and that there is no time to lose for governments to act on these commitments. In fact, the resolution’s two main areas strengthening the economic, social, and parenting capacity of families to prevent family breakdown and providing quality alternative care solutions that meet the needs of the individual child in case of necessary child family separation, are key to tackle and reverse these negative trends. Besides a missed opportunity with dreadful consequences for many children, not implementing the resolution can lead to the perception that international policymaking remains at a higher distant level, too far from the realities said to be changed. Bringing international policy to the local level for real impact will show the importance of multilateralism at a time where it is highly needed. Measures with a lasting positive impact The resolution shows that when we take measures to protect children in need of alternative care and prevent family breakdown, we are supporting the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs . At a time when governments, pressured by the immediate and long term consequences of the COVID 19 pandemic and other crises, are searching for ways to build back better while achieving sustainable development, implementing this resolution is a practical, detailed and impactful tool to achieve both. The ramifications of proper social protection floors paragraph 34 g , listening to the voices of children paragraph. 34k and improving gate keeping systems paragraph 34l have a far reaching impact and are an indicator for policies that are sustainable. With a wealth of direct experience in providing care to children and effectively preventing child family separation, organizations such as SOS Children’s Villages offer support to governments around the world to build a bridge between the policymaking level and adapting solutions to different contexts on the ground as well as to monitor implementation and good practices effectively. Making everyone aware of governments’ commitments A first step towards effective implementation is reaching all those who work with and for children to be aware of the commitments and solutions laid out in the resolution. Policy agreements and frameworks can often seem distant and complex to those who directly work with children and young people but are crucial in their role as care experts to implement measures. The new user friendly version https www.sos childrensvillages.org getmedia 418236da 103d 40d7 87b2 e8ea3037ca37 2019 UN Resolution user friendly version.pdf of the UN Rights of the Child Resolution focusing on children without parental care explains the original text in an easy to follow way targeting policy makers, care professionals, social workers and all those working with and for children, including judges, lawyers, health professionals, teachers and government officers. Building on the potential of partnerships including children and young people The direct experience of caregivers on the ground coupled with expert knowledge on care solutions, social protection measures and support for families is key for effective implementation of child rights frameworks. It takes a multi stakeholder partnership to adequately assess different realities, find solutions to challenges and maintain ongoing dialogue with governments to make the commitments of the resolution a reality for children. Children who lived in difficult family situations or who needed to be separated from their parents are experts on knowing the consequences and coming up with solutions. However, they are often not heard, in the very courthouses, police stations, hospitals, social service centers and schools that decide over their destiny, let alone in the policy making arena. It is their right to be heard, and this should happen by treating them as equal partners aiming to find solutions in debates and decisions affecting their lives. Partnering with children and young people directly can significantly contribute to implement commitments made in the resolution and other child rights frameworks effectively. They can guide us on how to turn words into action and make policies lead to positive impact for all. On the occasion of commemorating the anniversary of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the official date when children were recognized as particular rights holders 31 years ago, the international community should seize the opportunity of using shared expertise to confront current challenges and crises for the benefit of the individual child and societies as a whole.",['Epidemic']

"According to statistics from the Vietnam Disaster Management Agency, over the past 20 years, the northern mountainous provinces have experienced more than 300 flash floods, mud and rock floods with an increasingly large scale and scope, causing a lot of damage on people, property and infrastructure. To prevent, avoid and limit damage caused by flash floods and landslides, forecasting and early warning plays a very important role. Flash floods and landslides are becoming more and more complicated Cao Bang is one of the northern mountainous provinces with mountainous terrain, high slopes, and often suffers from natural disasters such as hail, tornadoes, flash floods, landslides... causing a lot of damage. According to the Commanding Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control and Search and Rescue of Cao Bang Province, in 2020, natural disasters caused nearly VND 80 billion in damage and claimed three lives. In which, floods, flash floods, landslides occurred in all 10 10 districts and cities in the province, affected more than 6,000 houses. Many traffic works, schools, cultural houses, hospitals, irrigation works, clean water were damaged. In Yen Bai, statistics show that the whole province currently has 1,166 locations where flash floods and landslides are frequent. Specifically, there are 682.44 km2 with high risk of flash floods 182.4 km2 has a very high risk of landslides and 144.6 km2 is at high risk, so it is very important to require early warning of flash floods and landslides. In Dien Bien province, in the past three years 2018 2020 , there hasn't been a year without heavy damage to people and property caused by floods, flash floods and landslides. According to Dien Bien Provincial Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control and Search and Rescue, in 2020, natural disasters in Dien Bien killed four people and injured six 3,849 houses were damaged or collapsed 2,500 ha of rice, crops and nearly 100 irrigation works, bridges, schools were damaged… total damage was over 263 billion VND. According to Deputy Chief of the Office of the Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control and Search and Rescue of Dien Bien Province, Nguyen Duc Dang, despite actively propagandizing and warning about the risk of floods and flash floods in localities, natural disasters are becoming more and more severe and extremely unpredictable. An increase in the density and intensity of landslides, rockslides and flash floods was also recorded in Lao Cai province. Data from the Commanding Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control and Search and Rescue in Lao Cai province said that in the past 10 years, Lao Cai has had 59 heavy rains 27 flash floods, landslides along with many other types of natural disasters, killing 226 people, eight people went missing 229 people were injured... Economic damage is estimated at more than 4,624 billion VND, an average of 400 to 500 billion VND year. Enhance warning capacity According to the Vietnam Disaster Managemnet Agency, in recent years, the northern mountainous provinces are often affected by local heavy rains, causing flash floods, landslides, serious damage to life and property of people. Therefore, in order to actively respond to this type of disaster, along with the need to develop a system of warning maps and disaster maps, maps of evacuation locations, the appropriate development and use of real time monitoring and early warning systems is essential. Sharing about the existing flash flood and landslide warning system in the northern mountainous region, Dr. Le Quang Tuan, Deputy Director of the Department of Science, Technology and International Cooperation, Vietnam Disaster Managemnet Agency said that developing early warning systems is very important and is the most proactive solution to reduce disaster risk. The forecasting and warning work has made certain progress, the national forecasting agency has issued forecast bulletins to the district level, regularly updating and supplementing the situation of natural disasters to serve the work of the directing the response a specialized warning and monitoring system with the application of many prevention solutions, but there seems to be no effective solution to stop or minimize the impact and damage caused by flash floods and landslides. Recorded in Lao Cai province, there are currently nine hydrometeorological stations 53 automatic rain gauge stations three natural disaster early warning systems are invested from domestic capital, while the disaster warning systems of Korea, the mud and rock flood warning station of Taiwan China are running trials... but Due to the complex terrain, scattered population, plus limited funding, the investment and installation of equipment and disaster early warning systems are only prioritized for key places... In Cao Bang province, Deputy Director of the Sub Department, in charge of the Sub Department of Irrigation Ma Thi Huyen Linh, said that in order to gradually overcome limitations in disaster warning work for people to know and take the initiative in natural disaster prevention and control to meet practical requirements, the Provincial People's Committee needs to provide additional support about 90 million VND year operating and maintenance costs for monitoring stations to operate to perform disaster warning tasks. Lack of funding has been affecting the capacity to warn of flash floods and landslides in the northern mountainous provinces. However, in addition to financial difficulties, many provinces also face the shortage and unprofessionalism of natural disaster prevention and control forces. In many localities, instead of arranging full time officers, this force is mainly part time, leading to most of the staff not having basic training in disaster prevention and control, so it is difficult to deploy coordination between all levels and sectors in the locality. Along with that, the investment in equipping more facilities and tools to support the improvement of disaster prevention capacity at all levels, strengthening the activities of disaster prevention and control teams at commune, village and hamlet levels to proactively respond and rescue according to the four on the spot motto is still limited. According to Deputy Chief of the Office of the Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control of Dien Bien Province Nguyen Duc Dang, to improve the warning capacity of flash floods and landslides, in 2020, the Provincial People's Committee has allocated 610 million VND to install equipment to serve the activities of the Provincial Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control urged units to donate more than 20 billion VND to the disaster prevention and control fund organized training to improve the capacity of forecasting and responding to natural disasters for nearly 1,500 people who are the people, officials, civil servants and the armed forces. According to Dr. Le Quang Tuan, it is necessary to develop a real time disaster warning system, based on continuous monitoring data, this requires a huge investment and needs to combine all four groups of solutions. including Developing and using an early warning system associated with an online map of zoning risks and disasters of flash floods, landslides, etc., with clear running paths and safe shelters. on the map for people promoting education, communication, training and drills for local authorities and people hamlets, villages and communes on the use of maps and early warning systems including educational content on skills to recognize and respond to flash floods and landslides into primary education curricula in mountainous areas. Socializing investment resources, managing operations, subscribing to warning information about flash floods and landslides strengthening guidance and mobilizing people to install and use people's rain gauge stations to forecast and warn about the possibility of imminent flash floods and landslides. Finally, the Government and authorities at all levels need to pay more attention to investing and implementing large scale projects and schemes in order to develop a real time monitoring and early warning system at national scale, smooth online connection from the Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control to local authorities at all levels.

" SG SM 20273 Following are UN Secretary General António Guterres’ remarks at the high‑level event of the International Support Group for Lebanon, held today Thank you for coming together to reaffirm your support for Lebanon, its people and its stability. Our hearts are heavy for those who perished or were injured as a result of the devastating 4 August explosions. Sadly, Lebanon faces a perfect storm — a protracted financial and socioeconomic crisis with an unprecedented rise in unemployment and poverty, coupled with the COVID 19 pandemic. The disastrous explosions last month exacerbated these challenges. This latest tragedy must be a wake up call. Eleven months after so many took to the streets calling for change, we hope for tangible steps to implement economic, social and political reforms. The designation of Mr. Mustapha Adib as Prime Minister is a step in the right direction. This should be followed by the swift formation of a Government able to meet the legitimate aspirations and needs expressed by the Lebanese people and to quickly deliver on key reforms and fundamental changes. Without such action, the country’s ability to recover and rebuild will be jeopardized, adding to the turmoil and hardship for the Lebanese people. Now is the time for transformation in a variety of sectors, including financial, banking and energy, as well as customs, public procurement and State‑owned enterprises. Social reforms, including social protection, are also needed to ensure the well being of all Lebanese, particularly the most vulnerable. Ultimately, reforms are not a goal in itself. They should respond to the legitimate demands of the Lebanese people for greater welfare, accountability, transparency and the capacity to tackle corruption. That is essential to regain the trust of the Lebanese citizens. I salute civil society organizations, women’s rights activists and social movements as they work to respond to the needs of the population. Since the explosion, the United Nations has led an urgent humanitarian response while looking at long term measures that will put Lebanon back on a path to stability and sustainable development. I welcome your support and cooperation. The United Nations and our partners are undertaking a three pronged approach one, relief assistance two, early recovery and three, reform, recovery and reconstruction. Scaling up international assistance is central to a people centred crisis response. Close coordination is also critical with the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Lebanon, along with Governments, donors and humanitarian and development actors and the Lebanese Armed Forces in light of their leading role in distributing relief efforts. Let us also remember that apart from Palestine refugees, Lebanon has also generously hosted close to 1 million Syrian refugees. I welcome France’s initiative to host a second donor conference in October. I want to reiterate my solidarity with the Lebanese people in these difficult times and my hope that Lebanese political leaders will rise to the occasion. This is the time to prioritize national interest and put people before politics. This is the time to work together to build a better future for Lebanon. With your support — and the commitment of the Lebanese Government — we can all do our part for the Lebanese people. Thank you.","['Epidemic', 'Technological Disaster']"
" KEY MESSAGES Increase in need 3.5 million people are now affected by drought, an increase from 2.7 million in May. The new statistics are a result of an assessment by the Kenya Food Security Steering Group covering 14 of the 23 arid and semi arid lands counties. A total of Kshs. 11.1 billion US 10.6 million will be required for response measures between July and December 2017. Low rainfall The Mid Season assessment confirmed the delayed onset of the long rains in both marginal agricultural areas and pastoral zones. The March to May 2017 long rains were characterized by uneven geographical distribution and prolonged dry spells. This resulted in poor crop performance and crop failure in some regions. Fall Army Worm invasion Cases of Fall Armyworm were reported in 23 counties with over 800,000 hectares threatened. Fewer meals per day A greater numbers of poor families are unable to meet their minimum dietary needs across Kenya. The mid season assessment indicates that households are eating less often and that their diets are less nutritious and diverse. Families are adopting nutrition coping strategies such as relying on cheaper food and reducing the number, portion and size of meals. As food consumption decreases, malnutrition is on the rise. Education blocked 4,500 children were unable to access their education after 18 schools closed in the northeastern part of the country due to heightened insecurity. Election looms Public attention to the drought is being overshadowed by the country’s general elections scheduled for August 2017. World Vision has developed a contingency plan to respond to any humanitarian issues that may arise during the election. HUMANITARIAN SITUATION OVERVIEW Poor Crop performance The onset of the March to May long rains was delayed and characterized by uneven geographical distribution and prolonged dry spells. Although some southeastern and coastal areas recorded above normal rainfall, Kenya was largely sunny and dry throughout March and experienced depressed rainfall during April and May. This resulted in poor crop performance and even crop failure in some regions. Disease Outbreaks Disease outbreaks continue in parts of the country. There is an active Cholera outbreak in five counties Garissa, Nairobi, Muranga, Turkana and Nakuru with 581 confirmed cases and seven deaths CFR 1.2 per cent . A dengue fever outbreak also continues in Mombasa and Wajir Counties, with 1,015 cases, and one death CFR 0.1 reported to date. In addition, 17 cases of Measles were reported in Garissa County’s Dadaab refugee camp with no death reported so far. Increasing Sudanese Refugees Kenya continues to receive an increased number of refugees from South Sudan, with 10,772 new arrivals from South Sudan since January 2017. The majority of new arrivals 69.7 are from Central Equatoria. The situation in Kakuma and Kalobeyei Refugee camps is further aggravated by the ongoing cholera outbreak. Restricted Access Humanitarian access in East Pokot sub county of Baringo County remains severely constrained due to ongoing intercommunal conflict and security operations by government forces. While the humanitarian situation in the sub county is of great concern especially the malnutrition situation access to the affected population is extremely limited. About fifteen health facilities in the area remain closed, and the remaining nineteen facilities are operating suboptimally.","['Drought', 'Epidemic', 'Insect Infestation']"

" Khartoum, Sudan, 18 November 2020 Clashes that started in the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia on November 4th have already forced over 27,000 people to flee the fighting and cross the borders into Sudan with an average of 4,000 people arriving on a daily basis. This figure is predicted to rise to a staggering 200,000 over the coming days and weeks, putting immense pressure on existing structures in the border Sudanese states of Gedaref and Kassala, which have not seen displacement of this level for over 2 decades. Program Director for CARE International in Sudan, Tesfaye Hussein says “More than half of the people arriving are women, children and a significant number of them are pregnant and lactating mothers which adds additional challenges and health risks. Among these are also incredibly vulnerable female headed households, or those with elderly relatives who have lost everything in the conflict. The number of refugees already exceeds the capacity of the two sites designated by the government for this influx and the border areas are congested with people waiting to be relocated. People are arriving exhausted and afraid – it is truly a terrible situation.” CARE has a sub office in Kassala and Gedaref States and implements WASH, health, nutrition, and COVID 19 responses targeting host community members and more than 40,000 refugees in Shagrab Refugee camp, close to where the new refugees have arrived. The most urgent immediate needs are food, water, sanitation and hygiene WASH , health and nutrition services, sanitary pads for women and girls of reproductive ages and emergency shelter. Hussein notes “Sudan is already recovering from some of the worst floods in our recent history, with over 7 million people facing high levels of acute food insecurity, as well as continuing COVID 19 cases and a resurgence of Polio cases in Gedaref, that are putting added pressure on a stretched health system. Now the arrival of potentially hundreds of thousands of refugees who are desperately in need of everything from food, to medical care and a place to stay, is creating a true humanitarian crisis for the country, the likes of which have not been seen for many years. This is not a situation we predicted in our emergency scenario planning. We are honestly worried how we will cope.” CARE is currently appealing for over US 1 million to provide water, sanitation and hygiene services as well as health, and nutrition services to refugees in both Kassala and Gedaref states. CARE has already released 70,000 of internal emergency funds but more is urgently needed to help thousands of the most vulnerable people arriving into Sudan. ENDS CARE in Sudan CARE has been working in Sudan since 1979 supporting poor communities to improve Food Security, Nutrition and Livelihood, Health and WASH among others. CARE has a well established management and logistics infrastructure managed by experienced program and support staff, with adequate vehicles, offices, financial management and accountability systems and procedures. CARE staff has an excellent understanding of the particular operating contexts of the regions it operates in different parts of Sudan including Darfur, Kordofan, Kassala and is able to successfully respond to rapid and slow onset emergencies. Notes • Sudan food crisis Flooding, rampant inflation, political instability and tribal clashes have triggered higher levels of acute food insecurity during the period of October December 2020 than predicted. An estimated 7.1 million people are expected to face high levels of acute food insecurity IPC Phase 3 or above through December 2020 and are in need of urgent action to save lives, protect livelihoods and reduce food consumption gaps. Nearly 1.3 million people will likely remain in Emergency IPC Phase 4 , nearly 6 million people in Crisis IPC Phase 3 and over 17 million people are estimated to be in Stressed IPC Phase 2 food security situations https reliefweb.int report sudan sudan ipc acute food insecurity analysis october december 2020 issued november 2020 https reliefweb.int report sudan sudan ipc acute food insecurity analysis october december 2020 issued november 2020 • Coronavirus Sudan has seen a fivefold increase in the number of COVID 19 cases, up from about 10 cases per day at the start of November to around 50 cases a day. As of 15 November 2020, there were 15,047 people confirmed to have COVID 19 Sudan, including 1,175 fatalities, according to the Sudanese Federal Ministry of Health. • Flooding In September 2020, profuse and continuous rainfall in Sudan caused a devastating flood across at least 16 Sudanese states with the Blue Nile reaching water levels not seen for nearly a century. It ranks among the most severe floods recorded in the region. Authorities declared a three month state of emergency in early September after the worst flooding in 30 years. Over 875,000 people were directly affected by flooding, including around 155 deaths over 175,000 houses either destroyed or damaged and around 1.4 million hectares of cropped land submerged by waters.","['Epidemic', 'Flood']"
" Background of the analysis The Heavy rainfall and out rushed water from Upstream India caused unusual flood. Since the beginning of August, monsoon rains covering almost the whole country and upstream areas in India and Nepal gradually created severe flooding in Bangladesh. Flood water in Bangladesh passes through the country from north to south to the Bay of Bengal . Presently flood water in northern districts is almost receded. However, the flood left great devastation in the northern areas which are highly poverty stricken areas. Flooding in this area is recurrent yearly phenomena which prevents the area to get rid of the poverty and other vulnerabilities. Two assessments 72 hours assessment and aerial assessment has already conducted by Needs Assessment Working Group NAWG in the northern part in August 2017 when the flood affected areas were inundated. Needs were identified and response plans were prepared based on these assessment by many agencies. As the water has receded and affected people are trying to go back to their regular life in between, needs and priority might have changed for them. So, NAWG has decided to conduct another round of quick need analysis to identify the changed needs and priorities in the affected areas. According to the available affected population data from Department of Disaster Management DDM 1, 15 districts were identified. One upazilla from each district was selected for data collection based on the most affected population. Two upazilas were selected from 6 districts which had been identified in the HCTT response plan as the most affected. Finally, data was collected from 18 upazilas of 12 affected districts for this needs analysis. Objectives and Methodology The objective of this need analysis was to identify the key priority districts, priority sectors and need for those sectors relevant and appropriate in the current changed situation. 15 priority district was identified from most affected population mentioned in MoDMR situation report, of which one most affected upazila was selected for data collection. Two Upazilas were selected from the top six priority districts identified in HCTT response plan. Finally data was collected from 18 upazilas of 12 districts as per the presence and interest of agencies among the identified upazilas. A semi structured checklist was developed on the basis of last 72 hours assessment checklist with a little modification for this analysis. A key informant interview KII was conducted with the PIOs of each of the 18 upazilas.","['Flash Flood', 'Flood', 'Land Slide', 'Mud Slide']"
" Map Information Category 4 Hurricane Matthew is threatening the Caribbean with maximum sustained wind speed of 220 km h and heavy rainfall. It's slowly moving northward from the Caribbean Sea and is closing in delivering potentially catastrophic floods to Haiti. Hurricane Matthew is expected to pass very close to the western tip of the Tiburon Peninsula, which includes most of Haiti's southern coast. This event could dump up to 1 meter of rain and will likely produce life threatening flash floods and mudslides. The present map show basic topographic features derived from public datasets, refined by means of visual interpretation of pre event imagery.","['Flash Flood', 'Mud Slide', 'Tropical Cyclone']"
